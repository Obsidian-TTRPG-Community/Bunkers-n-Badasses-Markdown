## Loot Generation Quick Guide

No matter how much time you spent meticulously planning out your campaign, players will throw you for a loop and you may find yourself needing to generate stuff on the quick. Here are some easy guides so you don't have to pause the action and risk losing everyone to a snack break that leads to just a few short videos on the Echocast and now the night is shot.

No matter how much time you spent meticulously planning out your campaign, players will throw you for a loop and you may find yourself needing to generate stuff on the quick. Here are some easy guides so you don't have to pause the action and risk losing everyone to a snack break that leads to just a few short videos on the Echocast and now the night is shot.

Let’s start with the easy ones first: 

### Shields and Grenades
1. Roll for Guild on the Guild Chart
2. Reference either the Shield Chart or Grenade Chart respectively, and select the item that matches the Guild at the receiving player's Vault Hunter Level.
3. There is no step 3, that is how easy it is.

### Relics
1. Roll % on the Relics Table to determine effects and Rarity.
2. Roll 1d10 on the Class Table to determine the Class of the Relic.
3. Also no step 3.

Now it gets a little more complicated, so buckle up. As guns are the single most important Loot drop in the game, it’s important that you have the option to create nearly endless variations. Well, not endless, but more than | care to work out. (I'm sure there is a math whiz in your group who can figure out exactly how many variations can be made and will regale you all with it during a particularly tense moment in the action. If so, let me know. | am curious. Although not curious enough to figure it out myself.)

### Random Guns
Take a blank Gun Card and use the following steps to generate random guns:
1. Roll 1d8 twice on the Gun Table to determine the type of gun (row) and the Guild (column).

1d8 Roll Gun: `dice: 1d8`
1d8 Roll Guild: `dice: 1d8`

2. If a Favored Gun is rolled, select one of the Favored Guns of a party member.
3. Roll 1d4 and 1d6 on the Rarity Table to determine the Rarity and if it is Elemental.

**1d4 Roll:** `dice: 1d4`
**1d6 Roll:** `dice: 1d6`

4. Fill in the gun stats from the gun type based on Vault Hunter Level.
5. Fill in the Guild bonuses found on the respective Guild page based on the gun's Rarity.
6.  If the gun indicates Elemental, roll % on the Elemental Table to determine Elemental Damage possibility (Alas! and Blackpowder are never Elemental; Malefactor is always).

7.  If you want to add dimension to any gun, you can add a prefix from the Prefix Table. For example, a Common Pistol can become an Adorable Common Pistol that has a 25% chance of distracting Enemies with images of cute animals.

8.  For Epic or Legendary Guns, in addition to prefixes, you can add Red Text from the Red Text Table. **Example**: THE PICKLES! Shoots flaming cheeseburgers that deal an extra 2d6 Incendiary Damage.


9. Take a moment just for yourself, that was a lot of steps.
