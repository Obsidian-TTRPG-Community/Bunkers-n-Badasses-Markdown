## Grenades as Loot
Imagine aiming a magic wand at a group of Enemies and shooting a powerful ball of dark matter at them, causing them immense Damage. Except it isn't from a wand, it’s from your hand. And it isn't a ball of dark matter, it’s a grenade. Grenades on Pan’Dorah can have a lot of varied effects. Have fun exploring the different ways you can allow players to kill things.
