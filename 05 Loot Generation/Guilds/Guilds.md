## Guilds
THOUGH LACKING a central government, the realm of Pan'Dorah is not without powerful entities who control the fate of the world. Much like the real-life gun manufacturers you may be familiar with, these magical Guilds develop, upgrade, and sell all manner of magical guns and equipment to a grateful populace. Or at least, to a populace they've tricked into gratefulness. Without the Guilds, everyone would still be going around stabbing each other.

Most of the creatures of Panâ€™Dorah don't have the higher brain function to pick up a gun or equip a Shield, but the denizens of the land have quickly adopted the defenses offered by these megacorporations. Most city walls, for instance, come equipped with Dahlia automated ballistas, while many magical academies prefer to use Malefactor protection spells.

The Guilds have a variety of different goals in the world of Pan'Dorah, and a variety of different opinions about Vault Hunters. some consider Vault Hunters useful assets in acquiring important items or wiping out competition. Others consider them nuisances who ultimately cost far more gold than they earn.

Some Guilds operate like cruel, fascist monarchies, keeping their citizenry under strict watch. Others are focused purely on the achievement of magical knowledge, no matter the consequence. Others just wanna make enough gold to cure world hunger, and then spend the rest of their lives not curing world hunger.
