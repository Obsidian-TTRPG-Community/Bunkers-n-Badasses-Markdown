## Melee Weapons

>[!homebrew]
> Warning: This content is a Homebrew created for Bunkers and Badasses.

Melee weapons are special, equippable items that enhance your melee attacks. They do not take up a gun slot, but you can only have one equipped at a time. There are four manufacturers of melee weapons: Valora, Swifft, Kleave, and BONK. Each manufacturer provides a unique bonus for all their weapons.

## Generate a Melee Weapon
### Rarity
To obtain a Melee Weapon, roll on the Gun Rarity table found in the Bunkers & Badasses sourcebook.

![](_attachments/BnB-Rarity-Table.md#^BnBRarity)

### Manufacturer
Then, roll a d4 to determine the manufacturer of the Melee Weapon.

|`dice: 1d4` Roll | Manufacturer |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1                | [Valora Expanded](Valora%20Expanded.md)       |
| 2                | [Swift Expanded](Swift%20Expanded.md)        |
| 3                | [Kleave Expanded](Kleave%20Expanded.md)        |
| 4                | [BONK!](../Guilds/Bonk.md)             |

### Prefixes
Prefixes are special effects that are added to your weapon, typically activating when you strike an enemy. To determine the prefix of an uncommon or higher rarity Melee Weapon, roll a d20 and use the result to choose from the prefix options listed below.

| `dice: 1d20` Roll | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1-6 | None. |
| 7-8 | **Ancient:** When you deal Melee Damage, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 20, recover one daily use of your Action Skill. |
| 9-10 | **Amp’d:** When you deal Melee Damage, your Gun Attacks deal an additional +2d4 Damage until the end of your next turn. |
| 11-12 | **Archmage’s:** When you deal Melee Damage, roll a `dice: d20`. On 20, you gain an additional grenade. |
| 13-14 | **Caustic:** When you deal Melee Damage, gain an additional +2d4 Elemental Damage until the start of your next turn. |
| 15-16 | **Echoing:** Your Melee Attacks deal an additional +1d4 Damage for each Gun Attack you made on the previous turn.|
| 17-18 | **Vampiric:** When you deal Melee Damage, you gain either `dice: 1d4` Health or `dice: 1d4` Shield Capacity (whichever is lower). |
| 19-20 | **Warrior’s:** When you deal Melee Damage, you gain +1d4 Damage Reduction and +1d4 Melee Damage until the start of your next turn. |

### Red Text (Optional)
Melee Weapons of any rarity can be given special abilities, known as Red Text, which can either enhance the abilities provided by their manufacturer or add entirely new abilities to the weapon. Get creative with your Red Text choices to make your Melee Weapon truly unique.

## Melee Weapons with Elements

Melee weapons that have elemental properties will add that element to all Melee Damage you deal, regardless of whether or not it is classified as a Melee Attack.
