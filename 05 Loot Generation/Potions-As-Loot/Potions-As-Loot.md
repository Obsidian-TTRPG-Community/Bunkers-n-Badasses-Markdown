## Potions as Loot

Potions are one-time use items that are ingested orally and grant a variety of effects for the Vault Hunter. Potion technology has come a long way, but potion-carrying technology is still lacking, so a Vault Hunter can only carry a limited amount of potion vials to prevent possible breakage.

At Level 9, players can unlock another slot to carry potions; another slot can be unlocked by Leveling Up a second Archetype to Level 9.
