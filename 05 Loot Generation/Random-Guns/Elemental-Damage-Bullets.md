## Elemental Damage
When normal bullets aren't enough, add the magic of the Elements.

üî• **INCENDIARY**: Incendiary is a fancy way to say fire. Incendiary Damage deals double Damage to targets with exposed Flesh. Once Shields or Armor are depleted, all Health Damage is double for Flesh targets. Mmmm smells like chicken.

‚ò£Ô∏è **CORROSIVE**: Magical melty stuff that eats through Armor and Metal, dealing double Damage.

‚ö° **SHOCK**: Ben Franklin never meant for it to be used as a weapon. shock Damage deals double Damage to Shields.

üí• **EXPLOSIVE**: Explosive Damage makes a big BOOM and always includes Splash, which deals additional half Damage to all adjacent squares. Explosive also has a 30% chance to cause Knockhack, kicking the target back one square away from the Damage source.

‚ò¢Ô∏è **RADIATION**: Makes you glow from the inside and out. Radiation Damage can penetrate through Shields and deal Damage directly to‚Äô Health. If a target dies while taking Radiation Damage, they explode and deal 3d6 Splash Radiation Damage.

‚ùÑÔ∏è **CRYO**: Cryo = really cold. Targets Hit by Cryo Damage are Slowed, which means they can only move one square for one turn - after being Hit and get -2 to Traverse Checks. If a target is Hit again with Cryo, they become Frozen. A Frozen target can either move one square on their turn or make a Melee Attack.

The Elemental Table determines whether or not a gun deals Elemental Damage, what type of Damage, and if there is any bonus Damage. N/A indicates the gun is not Elemental. All Damage dealt with an Elemental gun is Elemental Damage, and inflicts the corresponding Damage effects. Bonus Damage adds dice results to the overall Damage Roll.
