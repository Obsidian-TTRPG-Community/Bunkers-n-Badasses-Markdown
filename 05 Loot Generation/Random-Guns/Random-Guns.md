## Random-Guns
Take a blank Gun Card and use the following steps to generate random guns:
1. Roll 1d8 twice on the Gun Table to determine the type of gun (row) and the Guild (column).

1d8 Roll Gun: `dice: 1d8`
1d8 Roll Guild: `dice: 1d8`

2. If a Favored Gun is rolled, select one of the Favored Guns of a party member.
3. Roll 1d4 and 1d6 on the Rarity Table to determine the Rarity and if it is Elemental.

**1d4 Roll:** `dice: 1d4`
**1d6 Roll:** `dice: 1d6`

4. Fill in the gun stats from the gun type based on Vault Hunter Level.
5. Fill in the Guild bonuses found on the respective Guild page based on the gun's Rarity.
6.  If the gun indicates Elemental, roll % on the Elemental Table to determine Elemental Damage possibility (Alas! and Blackpowder are never Elemental; Malefactor is always).

7.  If you want to add dimension to any gun, you can add a prefix from the Prefix Table. For example, a Common Pistol can become an Adorable Common Pistol that has a 25% chance of distracting Enemies with images of cute animals.

8.  For Epic or Legendary Guns, in addition to prefixes, you can add Red Text from the Red Text Table. **Example**: THE PICKLES! Shoots flaming cheeseburgers that deal an extra 2d6 Incendiary Damage.
9. Take a moment just for yourself, that was a lot of steps.
