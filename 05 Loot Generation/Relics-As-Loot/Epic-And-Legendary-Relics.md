## Epic and Legendary Relics

Relics can be a fun way to personalize your game and make your players feel special. You can create Relics that are party-member specific. For example, if you have a friend in your group who is always late to game sessions or to meet up for dinner, you can create a Legendary Relic called Unpunctual that has +4 SPD and a Class bonus of +2 SPD. She gets the burn.

Or you can just play it straight with something like: 
**Legendary Incendiary Relic**: add +3d6 Incendiary Damage to all Melee Attacks, with Class Bonus add +1d6 to all Ranged Attacks with Favored Guns.
