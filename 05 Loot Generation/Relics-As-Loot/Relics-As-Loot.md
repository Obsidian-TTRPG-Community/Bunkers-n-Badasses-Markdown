## Relics as Loot
Relics are mystical items rumored to have been left behind by aliens centuries ago. Well, not exactly rumored; Deranged Daryl is the only one on Panâ€™Dorah who believes that, and he was dropped on his head as an adult. Wherever they came from, they are a mystery to behold. If a Vault Hunter has one in their possession, they are imbued with its powers. If someone has more than one on them the powers no longer work, no crossing the streams or some such.

Some Relics work better with some Classes because reasons.

### How to Generate Loot
1. Roll % on the Relics Table to determine effects and Rarity.

![](_attachments/Relic-Table.md#^BnBRelics)

2. Roll 1d10 on the Class Table to determine the Class of the Relic.

**1d10 Roll**: `dice: 1d10`

![](_attachments/Base-Class-Relic-Table.md#^BnBClassRelicBase)

3. Also no step 3.
