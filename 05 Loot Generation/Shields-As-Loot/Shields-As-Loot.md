## Shields as Loot
Unlike the stupid sheets of metal your Enemies will use to protect themselves from your bullets, Vault Hunter Shields are a bit more elegant. These magical items simply cast a constant protection spell on your skin, deflecting any unwanted Health Damage for as long as the Shield has power.

### How to Generate Loot
1. Roll for Guild on the Guild Chart.
![](_attachments/Guild-Table.md#^BnBGuild)

2. Reference the Shield Chart and select the item that matches the Guild at the receiving player's Vault Hunter Level.


3. There is no step 3, that is how easy it is.
