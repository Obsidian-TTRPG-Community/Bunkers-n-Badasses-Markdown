## Generating a Shield

### Rarity

Roll on the Gun Rarity table.

### Shield Type

Then roll 1d6 for Shield Type, and 1d12 for each Shield Mod, based on the item’s rarity. 

 > [!abstract] When creating a shield, you can use **Red Text** and **Prefixes** to create **Fixed Mods**, meaning you have less mods to add to the Shield.

| `dice: 1d6` - `dice: 1d12` | **Guild** | 1-6 | 7-12 | 13-18 | 19-24 | 25-30 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Ashen | [25 \| 10] | [50 \| 15] | [75 \| 20] | [100 \| 25] | [125 \| 30] |
| 3-4 | Hyperius | [15 \| 10] | [30 \| 15] | [45 \| 20] | [60 \| 25] | [75 \| 30] |
| 5-6 | Pangoblin | [35 \| 10] | [70 \| 15] | [105 \| 20] | [140 \| 25] | [165 \| 30] |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Shield Rarity** |  | **Common** | **Uncommon** | **Rare** | **Epic** | **Legendary** |
| **Number of Mods** |  | 1 | 2 | 3* | 4* | 5* |

\*Special Shields, like those with **Red Text**, can have Fixed Mods that grant special effects. Reduce this number for each Fixed Mod.

|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Amp** | At Full Shield: Take Shield Damage on Ranged Attack to gain Bonus Ranged Damage. |
