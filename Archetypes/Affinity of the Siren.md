You were chosen, ambitious or perhaps unlucky. Whatever the reason, you are a Siren. Yet a Siren is not just about flashing tattoos and looking like a tribal psycho's bride, though that could be described as a perk, it is so much more. You are a manifestation of ideals, of nature, of elements. And guess what dearie? Today is the day you've just hit Siren puberty so buckle up, because its going to get ugly.

## Pick an Affinity

There can only be one of each affinity at any time. Affinities are very personal, destructive if known and must be kept secret from other players, especially other Siren's who have reached their peak Affinity.

The player must pick the affinity by their figurehead name after the Bunker Master has ensured any unavailable Affinity has been removed.

The **Primary Stat** also controls the **Siren Mod** for Siren-Specific Abilities and additional Elemental Rolls.

The **Secondary Stat** controls the **Affinity Mod** which will be utilised to change or boost certain effects. An ability on a gun rolled with an Affinity Mod will act differently than one rolled with a Siren Mod.

The details of these effects will be listed where available the Affinity Mod is available.

## Siren Feats

Unlike a normal archetype tree of feats, your abilities are varied, and thus you must be varied. Feats are grouped by what they do, and if they have any interlinking requirements.

### Elemental Feats

These feats are geared towards a Siren who wants to delve into the knowledge of elements long lost to history.
