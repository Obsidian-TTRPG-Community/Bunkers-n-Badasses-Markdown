## Formatting

These backgrounds are:  
- Searchable with the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin out of the box, by utilising Inline Keys in front of each description stat.  
- Additionally, I have added tags to each file to make them more useful in inquiries.  
- Each page comes with optional traits that are in the style of DnD personality trait tables. There may be repetition between backgrounds in the flaws and `any` alignments, because it's meant to be more generic for those.  
- The instructions for the Admonitions/Callout for `> [!skill]` can be found in [[Krindornothin/Legend/Callmonitions/Skill|[!skill]]. 
  

### Suggestions for Wonderlands Backgrounds

  
> [!quote] â€” Sigrunixia  
> The stats in Wonderlands are a bit different from the stats in BnB. I have made some suggestions for how to convert the stats below.  
  
| Wonderlands Stat | Bunkers and Badasses Replacement |  
|------------------|----------------------------------|  
| +2 STR | +1 DMG |  
| +2 DEX | +1 SPD |  
| +2 CON | +1 MAX HP (Mod) |  
| +2 INT | +1 MST |  
| +2 WIS | +1 ACC |  
| +2 ATT | +1 to Stat of Choice\* |  
\* You will select all stats once before you can select them again.  
\* For example, +4 Stat of Choice becomes 1 of Each Ability Score.  
  

### Checks

Additionally, I recommend that you change all odd stats above/below **5** to a check of that appropriate stat.  
- In the cases of STR conversion to checks, rotate starting at `SPD -> ACC -> MST -> SPD`.  
- CON will not convert to Checks as these are Modifiers. Instead, Odd stats above **5** will add `1d3 regen per turn`. Odd Stats below -5 will add `1d3 decay per turn`.  
  

### Conversion Example

> STR +4  
> INT + 5  
> Con -6  
  
Becomes:  
  
> +2 DMG  
> +2 MST  
> +1 to Loot Search Checks.  
> -3 Max HP  
> -1 to a Random Check.  
  

## Legal Disclaimer

Some backgrounds are from [Tiny Tina's Wonderlands](https://playwonderlands.2k.com), and have been reconfigured to fit the Bunkers and Badasses TTRPG. I have updated their text as well to keep the main theme of their description, while updating it to make sense for multiple play styles.
