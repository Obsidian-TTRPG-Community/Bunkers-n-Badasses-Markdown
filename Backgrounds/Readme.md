## Backgrounds

The backgrounds within this folder are homebrew[^1] content for Bunkers and Badasses. 

### Map of Backgrounds

- [[Apprentice Barnacle Snapper]]
- [[Clownblood]]
- [[Failed Monk]]
- [[Nerfed By The Bunker Master]]
- [[Raised By Elves]]
- [[Recovering Inventory Hoarder]]
- [[Rogue Alchemist]]
- [[Street Urchin Success Story]]
- [[Village Idiot]]

## Formatting

These backgrounds are:
- Searchable with the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin out of the box, by utilizing Inline Keys in front of each description stat. 
- Additionally, I have added tags to each file to make them more useful in inquiries.
- Each page comes with optional traits that are in the style of DnD personality trait tables. There may be repetition between backgrounds in the flaws and `any` alignments, because its meant to be more generic for those ones.
- The Admonitions/Callout for `>[!skill]` can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Bunkers-n-Badasses-Markdown/blob/main/Backgrounds/skill-admonition.json)**. Refer to the [Import Admonitions Setting](https://plugins.javalent.com/admonitions/settings#Importing+Custom+Admonitions)to install this `.json` file.

### Suggestions for Wonderlands Backgrounds

> [!quote] â€” Sigrunixia
 > The stats in Wonderlands are a bit different from the stats in BnB. I have made some suggestions for how to convert the stats below.

| Wonderlands Stat | Bunkers and Badasses Replacement |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| +2 STR           | +1 DMG                           |
| +2 DEX           | +1 SPD                           |
| +2 CON           | +1 MAX HP (Mod)                  |
| +2 INT           | +1 MST                           |
| +2 WIS           | +1 ACC                           |
| +2 ATT           | +1 to Stat of Choice\*           |
\* You will select all stats once before you can select them again.
\* For example, +4 Stat of Choice becomes 1 of Each Ability Score.

### Checks

Additionally, I recommend that you change all odd stats above/below **5** to a check of that appropriate stat. 
- In the cases of STR conversion to checks, rotate starting at  `SPD -> ACC -> MST -> SPD`.
- CON will not convert to Checks as these are Modifiers. Instead, Odd stats above **5** will add `1d3 regen per turn`. Odd Stats below -5 will add `1d3 decay per turn`.

### Conversion Example

For example:

> STR +4
> INT + 5
> Con -6

Becomes:

> +2 DMG
> +2 MST
> +1 to Loot Search Checks.
> -3 Max HP
> -1 to a Random Check.
