The Thresher is a fascinating creature that has made its way from the planet Elpis to Pandora, where it now thrives. These stubborn creatures are often found in soft ground areas such as along ocean shores or river beds, and their tentacled bodies come in a variety of colors and sizes.

Threshers are characterized by their long, bulbous heads that rest on an octopus-like body. From beneath the head, several long and spindly tentacles extend, making them look like something straight out of a nightmare. The Threshers' weak spots are the small eyes located on the side of their heads, as well as similar organs on their tentacles. Despite being well-anchored in the ground, Threshers can still be damaged by staggering effects, making them vulnerable to certain attacks.

Once defeated, a thresher's corpse will slip back down into its hole, out of sight. Their blood is green and can be seen when their weak areas are shot. It's also worth noting that if a thresher's tentacles are shot off, they can grow back.

Some of the more virulent Threshers have the ability to form shields, making them even more difficult to take down.
