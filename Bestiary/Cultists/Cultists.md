> Cultists are not just dangerous, they're downright disturbing. Their violent and sadistic tendencies are enough to send shivers down anyone's spine. They don't just worship strange and unsettling deities like the Almighty Robot Policeman or the Great Galactic Meat Train, they go to great lengths to show their devotion. This often includes gruesome rituals, human sacrifices, and paying their taxes.

>When it comes to social interactions, cultists are not the easiest to deal with. They tend to be uncomfortable and awkward around others, and their demeanor can be unsettling at best. They have no regard for the well-being of anyone outside their cult (and let's be honest, no regard for anyone), and will go to great lengths to advance their twisted agendas which seemingly change moment to moment.

> If you ever find yourself face-to-face with a cultist and are not armed to the teeth, I recommend running in the opposite direction as fast as you can. These are not people you want to mess with.
