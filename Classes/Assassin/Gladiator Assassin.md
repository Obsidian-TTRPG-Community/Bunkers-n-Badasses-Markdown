Gladiators are a style of Assassins in the six galaxies that are a specialised type of combatant that rely on powerful melee weapons to achieve their goals. These assassins specialise in taking out enemies quickly and efficiently, often relying on surprise attacks and powerful, calculated strikes to overwhelm their opponents. Their skill set includes a variety of deadly close-quarters combat techniques and acrobatic manoeuvres, allowing them to easily outmanoeuvre and overpower their targets. In addition to their physical prowess, Gladiators also possess advanced knowledge and tactics that enable them to identify weaknesses in the enemy’s defences and exploit them for maximum effect.

These warriors epitomise the frontier Corporate motto: "Killing is our business, and business is good."
