Gladiators are a style of Assassins in the six galaxies that are a specialized type of combatant that rely on powerful melee weapons to achieve their goals. These assassins specialize in taking out enemies quickly and efficiently, often relying on surprise attacks and powerful, calculated strikes to overwhelm their opponents. Their skill set includes a variety of deadly close-quarters combat techniques and acrobatic maneuvers, allowing them to easily outmaneuver and overpower their targets. In addition to their physical prowess, Gladiators also possess advanced knowledge and tactics that enable them to identify weaknesses in the enemy’s defenses and exploit them for maximum effect.

These warriors epitomize the frontier Corporate motto: "Killing is our business, and business is good."
