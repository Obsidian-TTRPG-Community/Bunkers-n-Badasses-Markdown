## The Siren of Death

*In another time and reality, it was rumored that an ancient Siren warned those who would listen not to seek out the seventh Siren. In my reality, however, no such warning was ever given, and the seventh Siren was discovered just like the others and thought to be one of the six. Perhaps that is why things are happening the way they are now, and why we hunt for **them**.*

### Summary

The Siren of Death is a being of fable and fairy tales due to their holders never being fully human, who are closely tied to the forces of death and mortality. They are often portrayed as a dark and ominous figure, feared and respected by those who encounter them. However, even with their association with death, the Siren of Death is not viewed in these tales as evil, but rather is seen as a necessary aspect of the cycle of life and death. You still never want to see them arrive at your doorstep though!

Outside the myth, The Siren of Death is a primordial of nature. They are highly skilled in the arts of magic and the arcane, including the use of necromancy, and are rumored to possess powerful psychic abilities as well. They also possess a range of abilities at their disposal that allow them to control and manipulate the speed of death itself, which has made them an enemy of [The Siren of Time](Siren%20of%20Time.md).

Although they are seemingly steeped in the realm of Death, the Siren of Death is not immune to the forces of life, and can be swayed by the motivations and circumstances of those who seek their aid. It is through this they have earned a reputation as a protector of life the ages of old, before the affinity faded into obscurity.

### Abilities of the Siren of Death

#### Phase Harness

PhaseHarness allows [[Siren of Death|The Siren of Death]] to absorb and harness the life energy of their surroundings, using it to fuel her powerful abilities. They can tap into this energy to enhance their strength and speed, or channel it into devastating attacks that can shatter their enemies. As they grow in power, their ability to harness this energy increases, allowing them to tap into more and more of it to unleash even greater destruction.

##### Life Energy

Life Energy regenerates passively at the start of every new day. It also regenerates if they land the killing blow on an entity.

Your max life energy you can hold is **100**.
