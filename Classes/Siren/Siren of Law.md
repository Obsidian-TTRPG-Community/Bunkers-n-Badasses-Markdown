# The Siren of Law

| Holder         | Figurehead | Manifestation | Sphere  |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Siren of Death | War        | Alkonost       | Chaos |

## Summary

The Siren of Law is a outlier in the chaotically sphered Sirens, who is responsible for maintaining social order while at the same time tasked with inducing necessary chaos. They are driven by an innate calling to philosophy and thought, figuring out long before their manifestation how the physical reality should be maintained. Determining that the task to enact this mandate falls to them, they work to keep the peace and ensure that the rules and laws of society they have deemed worthy are upheld, even if it means causing chaos themselves.

To accomplish this goal, the Siren of Law is willing to go to any lengths to achieve this calling. They may use their powers of persuasion, or manipulation, to convince others to follow the rules. Should those fail,  they may resort to more drastic measures such as coercion, force, or even their more recognizable manifestation, War.

At the same time, however, the Siren of Law is also aware of the dangers of imposing order too rigidly. They know that too much control can lead to stagnation and over conformity, and they are careful to strike a balance between maintaining order and allowing for enough creativity and individuality to prevent too much rebellion. In this way, they are as much a puppeteer and strategist as they are a dictator of the known galaxies.

This title was last held by Commandant Steele until their passing, it was then consumed by the Siren of Death.
