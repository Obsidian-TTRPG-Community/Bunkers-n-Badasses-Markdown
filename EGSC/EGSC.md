> [!scene] This appears to be a badly preserved guide on the Eridian Galactic Standard Calendar

## History

In the early days of space exploration within the Borderlands, it became clear to the merchant class conglomerate that relying on terrestrial and singular timekeeping systems would lead to confusion and delays. Factors such as time dilation and cultural differences necessitated the development of a standardised calendar that could accommodate the complexities of interstellar travel. 

Thus, the Galactic Standard Calendar was introduced alongside the second wave of spacefarers, providing a unified system for timekeeping. Over time, it was renamed the Eridian Galactic Standard Calendar, paying homage to the Eridians who had utilised a similar system before their enigmatic disappearance.

> [!hint] 
> The Time Siren, a Siren affiliated with the concept of time, holds significant influence in any modifications or decisions regarding the calendar system.

## Time

The Eridian Galactic Standard Calendar utilizes a straightforward decimal system, employing units of "`ticks`" and "`moments`" for time measurement. Notably, the enigmatic Siren of Time, who emerged after the discovery of the vaults but prior to the Vault of the Destroyer events, introduced the concept of a "`Cycle`" to mark the time of vault openings and the subsequent windows. However, this addition to the calendar system was not officially documented until 81 years after the Eridian scar event.

> [!npc] **Siren of Time**
> "As the guardian of temporal knowledge, I foresaw the importance of incorporating the notion of Cycles to track the openings of the vaults and their subsequent intervals. It was a pivotal moment in our understanding of time within the Borderlands universe."

| Time    | Ticks  | Moments |
| ------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1 Day   | 10     | 100     |
| 1 Week  | 100    | 1,000   |
| 1 Month | 1,000  | 10,000  |
| 1 Year  | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| 1 Cycle | 2 × 10^6      |    -     |


## Calendar System

As the Borderlands universe expanded with explorers, merchants, and other spacefarers, it became apparent that relying solely on the abstract concept of "ticks" for practical timekeeping proved challenging. In response, during the third wave of space exploration, names for days, weeks, and months were introduced to facilitate communication and everyday usage within the galactic community.

> [!npc] **Captain Zara, Seasoned Space Explorer**
> "When you're out there charting unknown territories, coordinating with fellow adventurers, and establishing trade routes, it's essential to have a common language for time. The addition of day, week, and month names brought a sense of familiarity and structure to our lives amidst the vastness of the Borderlands."

## Eras

Each era encapsulates a unique chapter in our history, allowing us to reflect on the trials and triumphs that shaped the Borderlands. The era names serve as guideposts, reminding us of the journey we've undertaken in this epic tale.
