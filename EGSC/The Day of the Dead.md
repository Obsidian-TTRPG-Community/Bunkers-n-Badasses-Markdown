> [!weather] The Day of the Dead
> Welcome to the raucous and colorful streets of Sanctuary, where the Day of the Dead festival comes alive with a Borderlands twist! Amidst the mayhem and chaos, we honor our fallen comrades, celebrating their wild and unforgettable lives in true vault-hunter style. Join the frenzy as you make offerings to the dearly departed, march alongside larger-than-life skeleton floats in a parade like no other, and indulge in mouthwatering, spicy delicacies and the foot-stomping beats of mariachi bandits.
