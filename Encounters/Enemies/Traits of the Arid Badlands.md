## The Arid Badlands

The Arid Badlands stretch far and wide, an expanse of desolate terrain and rugged savanna's. In this harsh and unforgiving land, the skies are filled with ferocious beasts, from the poison-toothed skags to the menacing rakks that swoop down to prey on the unwary. The Badlands are a place of danger, where bandit tribes roam freely, their nefarious activities tolerated by the weak and corrupt rulers of nearby cities.

Long ago, the Badlands were a hub of industry and prosperity, owned by powerful mage-lords who mined the land for its valuable minerals and created great factories that churned out magical artifacts. But now, the once-thriving city of Pyrestone is all but deserted, its once-bustling markets and workshops now abandoned and in ruins. The Badlands still contain remnants of the old magic factories and processing plants, but many are now overrun by monsters or have fallen into disrepair.

In the despair of the harshness of the environment, the remaining residents and visitors of the region are not entirely without resources. A working wind farm still stands, its turbines churning out ley energy to power nearby settlements. And the nearby Grimstone Mine, although perilous, holds rich veins of magical ores and gems, making it a prime target for those daring enough to risk the dangers of its inhabitants.
