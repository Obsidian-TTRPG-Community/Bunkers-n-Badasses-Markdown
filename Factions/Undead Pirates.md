> Loyal to the captain second and the Dragon Lord first, undead skeletal pirates haunt the seas of the Wonderlands, plundering and causing chaos wherever they go.

## Extended Details
These undead pirates may have been loyal to their living captain in life, but in death, their loyalty lies with the [Sarkantu](Sarkantu.md). With bony fingers forever grasping their weapons, these skeletal pirates roam the seas of the Wonderlands, following the orders of their undead leader and causing chaos wherever they go. Despite their ghoulish appearances, they are formidable foes, feared by all who dare to cross their path.
