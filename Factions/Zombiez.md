>[!scene] Zombiez
> **Details**:: Zombiez are undead brain sucking soulless "living impaired" humans. Not content to terrorize the Wonderlands with the pearly white bones of human remains, the [[Sarkantu|The Dragon Lord]] also reanimated many of the freshly dead to do his bidding in the form of Zombiez. Zombies come in many shapes and sizes although they are all human-like in appearance. They also have greenish-grey skin colors, and blackened eye sockets.
