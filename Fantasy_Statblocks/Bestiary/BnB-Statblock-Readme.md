# Bunkers & Badasses Statblock Layout for Obsidian TTRPG Plugin

## What Does it Looks Like?
![BnB Layout Version 1](_attachments/BNB-V1.png)

## The Codeblock: Bestiary
Note: `Layout: BunkersBestiary` Must be placed within the codeblock during the following conditions:
1. If BunkersBestiary is not your default layout.
2. If you have a monster or entity that shares the same name in another universe and thus would have a stat block in another layout. Example. Ancient Red Dragon.

Once the Code Block is saved the first time, you will be able to call the entity manually with the following codeblock.

````yaml
```statblock
monster: monstername
```
````

### How to Install
1. Download [Bunkers.json](_attachments/Bunkers.json) and import it into your Obsidian TTRPG Statblocks Plugin.
2. Download [BnB-TTRPG-Statblock-Monsters](_attachments/BnB-TTRPG-Statblock-Monsters.css) and place into your `.obsidian/snippets` directory.
3. Enable the snippet.
4. Copy the code block above and surround with the ` ```statblock ` codeblock. Confirm you see a screenshot similar to above.

## How to Use: Movement
The Movement property currently supports the following items:

- move x
- leap x
- burrow x
- flight x
- teleport x
- swim x

x equals the amount of squares the monster can move.

You can use any of these, and it will list them under the movement arrow, along with an icon indicating what type of movement and how many squares it will move. Do not use commas.

*Hover can be treated the same as flight, or be utilized as a Trait.*

## How to Use: Traits
Traits currently will wrap text if you have a monster that has many traits. However, this can make your code-block very, very big and weird looking. If possible, try to make your custom traits a special or an action.

## How to Use: Loot
The Loot section is intended only for the weird, obscure loot items you want to absolutely include on a monster in that bestiary at all times, typically bosses who drop a peculiar quest item. The is optional and if there is nothing entered in loot, the field disappears.
