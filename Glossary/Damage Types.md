### Corrosive Damage

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

=======
Corrosive Damage is a type of magical attack that deals significant damage to armour and metal objects, as well as living creatures. This damage is caused by a magical substance that eats away at the target, leaving it weakened and vulnerable. When a creature is hit with corrosive damage, the substance continues to work on the target, causing **double damage** to the affected area.

## Eldritch Damage

Eldritch damage is a unique combination the elemental damage types Radiation, Incendiary, and [[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Glossary/Damage Types#Cryo Damage|Cryo]].

It has the ability to bypass traditional defenses such as health, armor, and shields with ease, and can even penetrate through barriers. Its power is derived from the manipulation of dark, otherworldly energies, making it highly effective against supernatural and otherworldly creatures.

=======
Cryo damage refers to extremely low temperatures that can significantly slow down the movement of the affected targets. Upon being hit by Cryo damage, the target's mobility is reduced to *one square for a turn* (target gains [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Conditions#Slowed|Slow]]), and their ability to traverse is also reduced by **-2**. In case the target is hit with Cryo damage again, they become [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Conditions#Frozen|Frozen]], which allows them to *either* make a melee attack **or** move one square on their turn.

## Explosive Damage

Explosive damage is all about making as much damage as possible. 
When a target is hit with explosive damage, the resulting explosion will splash outwards, dealing *additional half damage* to **all adjacent squares**. Additionally, there is a **30%** chance that the force of the blast will cause [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Quick Effects#Knockback|Knockback]], sending the target flying **one** square away from the source of the damage.

## Incendiary Damage

Incendiary Damage ignites targets, burning their flesh and causing double damage to those with exposed skin. Once a target's shields or armour are depleted, all health damage to targets with exposed [[flesh|Flesh]] is doubled.

>[!hint] The smell of burning flesh is often associated with incendiary damage, and it can be quite effective psychologically against flesh-based targets.

## Radiation Damage

Arguably, a terrifying type of damage. Unlike other damage types, it can penetrate through Shields and deal damage directly to Health. If a target succumbs to Radiation Damage and dies, they explode, dealing `dice: 3d6` Splash Radiation Damage to all nearby creatures.

## Shock Damage

Shock Damage is like 100 potato batteries directed at you, dealing double damage to Shields.

### Shock Damage Effects

Shock Damage can also [[stun]] electronic devices and robotic enemies, leaving them temporarily inoperable.

For the unfortunate lifeform with a heart or a brain, Shock Damage also has a chance at catastrophic neurological effects such as [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Conditions#Paralysis|Paralysis]], [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Conditions#Sudden Death|Sudden Death]], or even [[Compendium/BnB/Sourcebook Homebrews/Glossary/Quick Effects#Drooling|Drooling]].
