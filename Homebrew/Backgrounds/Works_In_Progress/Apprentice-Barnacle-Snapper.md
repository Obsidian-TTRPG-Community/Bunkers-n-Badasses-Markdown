# Apprentice Barnacle Snapper
From the day you laid eyes on your first galleon, encrusted in sea warts from the pox'd kiss of the Umpteen Seas, it was your dream to someday wedge a chisel underneath those bad boys. It wasn't long before that dream became reality. You have a dockworker's brawn and a union paycheck, but now it's time for a new, less stupid dream.
