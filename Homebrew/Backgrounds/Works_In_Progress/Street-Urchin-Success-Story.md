# Street Urchin Success Story

It's the oldest story in the book. You and your filthy crew of pickpockets, and thieves had found yourselves one last job - the Big One. Something stank about it - worse than you - but you were just malnourished and desperate enough to try it.

We all know what happened next; it went pretty well. You all made a comfortable amount of money and moved out to the suburbs. Sometimes you write letters to each other, but it's been a while.
