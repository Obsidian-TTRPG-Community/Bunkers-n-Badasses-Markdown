# PhaseShout
_Requires_: [The Siren of Law](../The-Siren-of-Law.md)

The Siren of Law unleashes a powerful sonic shout that shatters objects and ripples through reality. They can move up to __4__ squares, dealing `dice: 1d10`(__1d10__) shock damage and `dice: 1d10`(__1d10__) physical damage to each target in or adjacent to any square moved past.

PhaseShout has a `dice: 1d12`(__1d12__) potential to stun targets for one round if it lands on a __1-5__.

- At level 30, this ability becomes [PhaseScream](PhaseScream.md)
