# PhaseTalk
*Requires*: [[The-Siren-of-Law|The Siren of Law]]

The Siren of Law unleashes a sonic shout that echoes through objects and briefly disrupts reality. They can move up to __3__ squares, dealing `dice: 1d8`(__1d8__) shock damage and `dice: 1d8`(__1d8__) physical damage to each target in or adjacent to any square moved past.

Phasetalk has a `dice: 1d8`(__1d8__) potential to stun targets for one round if it lands on a __1-4__.

- At level 16, this ability becomes [PhaseShout](PhaseShout.md)
