# The Siren of Revolution

| Holder    | Figurehead | Manifestation | Sphere  |
| --- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Amara    | Mayhem       | Nue       | Chaos |

The Siren of Revolution is a powerful and charismatic leader, able to rally the masses  and the unheard, and incite them to rise up against their oppressors. They possess a fiery passion and a burning desire for change, and will stop at nothing to see their goals realized. They are not content with the status quo and will always be pushing for progress and progress. They understand the power of the people and know how to use it to achieve their objectives.

Yet the Siren of Revolution is not without their flaws. One of their most prominent is their addiction to vengeance. They find a twisted pleasure in seeing their enemies suffer and fall, and will stop at nothing to bring about their humiliation and downfall. This desire for revenge can consume them, leading them to make rash decisions and act impulsively. It can also blind them to the consequences of their actions, leading to unintended harm and suffering for those they meant to free.

For this major flaw, their drive and determination may be unmatched among the Chaos and Order Sirens, and their ability to inspire and mobilize the masses to heel outstripping the [The Siren of Law](../Law/The-Siren-of-Law.md). When dealing with this living incarnation of Mayhem, one needs to remember that while they may be driven by their addiction to vengeance, their ultimate goal still remains to bring about change, and to bring about a better world for all. And for that, many are willing to follow them and fight alongside them, even if it means going to war.
