The Siren of Time has the ability to connect with her past and future selves in all realities, as long as she is alive in the current reality. 
## Summary
The Siren of Time is a mysterious and powerful being who possesses the extraordinary ability to connect with her past and future selves in all realities. This connection allows her to access knowledge and information from different points in time, communicate with her other selves, and even physically travel through time itself.

Rather than using her abilities for the greater good, the current Siren of Time is selfish and greedy, using her powers solely for her own benefit. She is willing to do whatever it takes to get what she wants, regardless of the consequences. Despite this, the Siren of Time remains a formidable force, using her abilities to manipulate and shape reality to her own ends. She is a powerful and enigmatic figure, who wields her powers with ruthless efficiency, always seeking to advance her own interests.

However, the Siren of Time's abilities are not without limits. She is only able to connect with her past and future selves as long as she is alive in the current reality. If she were to die, her connection to the other selves would be broken, and her ability to access the full extent of her powers would be lost.
