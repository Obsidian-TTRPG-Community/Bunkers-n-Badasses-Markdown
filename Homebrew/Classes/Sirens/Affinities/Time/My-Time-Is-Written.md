# My Time Is Written
*Requires*: [The Siren of Time](The-Siren-of-Time.md)

The Siren of Time can access knowledge and information from different points in time by consulting with their past or future selves, or accessing a time-lost database or library. However, this ability is hard to control without getting lost in themselves.

+10 to the current Insight Check if they succeed one of the following: 
- A coin flip with the result of heads
- A 1d100 (1d100) roll with an even result
