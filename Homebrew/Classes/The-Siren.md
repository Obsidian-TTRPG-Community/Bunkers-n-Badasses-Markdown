# Affinity of the Siren

> Technically its an Archetype but its a Siren-only Archetype so here it belongs!

You were chosen, ambitious, or perhaps unlucky. Whatever the reason, you are a Siren. Yet a Siren is not just about flashing tattoos and looking like a tribal psycho's bride, though that could be described as a perk, it is so much more. You are a manifestation of ideals, of nature, of elements. And guess what dearie? Today is the day you've just hit Siren puberty so buckle up, because its going to get ugly.

## Pick an Affinity
There can only be one of each affinity at any time. Affinities are very personal, destructive if known, and must be kept secret from other players, especially other Siren's who have reached their Affinity.

The player must pick the affinity by their figurehead name after the Bunker Master has ensured any unavailable Affinity has been removed.

| **Figurehead** | **Sphere** | **Primary Stat** | **Secondary Stat** |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Protection     | Balance    | MST              | DMG                |
| War            | Chaos      | DMG              | SPD                |
| Peace          | Order      | ACC              | DMG                |
| Justice        | Order      | ACC              | DMG                |
| Evolution               | Balance    | MST              | DMG                |
| Life           | Balance    | MST              | DMG                |
| Mayhem         | Chaos      | DMG              | SPD                   |

The **Primary Stat** also controls the **Siren Mod** for Siren-Specific Abilities and additional Elemental Rolls.

The **Secondary Stat** controls the **Affinity Mod** which will be utilized to change or boost certain effects. An ability on a gun rolled with an Affinity Mod will act differently than one rolled with a Siren Mod.

The details of these effects will be listed where available the Affinity Mod is available.

## The Siren's Starting Stats

### Prestige Mode
If you are already leveled within the campaign and are "prestiging" into a new Archetype then follow this formula instead.
- Look at the progression Tree Below and Determine Where you are supposed to be on the Tree as far as points allotted.
- Choose your Affinity: Chaos, Balance, or Order, as above.
- Allocate 30% Points to Primary Stat
- Allocate 30% Points to Affinity Stat
- Allocate 10% Points to Tertiary Stat
- Allocate Remainder Stat

If not dealing with whole, dividable numbers, round up or down as needed in the Tertiary and Remainder Stats

## Siren Feats
Unlike a normal archetype tree of feats, your abilities are varied, and thus you must be varied. Feats are grouped by what they do, and if they have any interlinking requirements.
