# Eldritch Damage
Eldritch damage is a unique combination of various elemental damage types, including radiation, incendiary, and cryo.

It has the ability to bypass traditional defenses such as health, armor, and shields with ease, and can even penetrate through barriers. Its power is derived from the manipulation of dark, otherworldly energies, making it highly effective against supernatural and otherworldly creatures.
