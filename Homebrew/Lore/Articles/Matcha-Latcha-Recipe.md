> Welcome to another transcribed version of week's edition of *Creature Feature: Recipes and More*… I'm your lovely, brilliantly shining unicorn host, Devvie Tells! This week in our recipe section, we have the famous Matcha Latcha, presented by its very creator, [Jrust](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/0-Courier/Locations/Wonderlands/Lightspire/Brighthoof/Glitteryards/The-Handsome-Hag/Jrust.md), owner and proprietor of Brighthoof's first and only lesbian bar [The Handsome Hag](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/0-Courier/Locations/Wonderlands/Lightspire/Brighthoof/Glitteryards/The-Handsome-Hag/The-Handsome-Hag.md). Take it away Lady Jrust.

>[!quote] Thank you Devvie. I'm sure your readers are acquainted with the dual purpose concoction of Matcha Latcha: an edible skin or scale paste. Today, I've decided to reveal the recipe for those brave enough to make it at home. Let's begin.

**Ingredients**
- Three Fresh [GOB-lin](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/Gamemaster/Mechanics/Bestiary/Goblinoids/Gob-Lins/Gob-Lins.md) Bouncing Beans from unwilling donors, mashed.
> [!quote] **Note**: *Pickled and Dried GOB-Lin Bouncing Beans will produce hallucinogenic effects, and may be considered a poison. I and the Handsome Hag are not liable for any resulting deaths as the result of any misapplication of the recipe.*
- Two [Troll](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/Gamemaster/Mechanics/Bestiary/Trolls/Troll.md) Toes, crushed. Any variant will do.
- One barrel of [Adult-Skag](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/0-Courier/Resort-Me/Adult-Skag.md)'s blood; Normal Variant Only. May also be found as [Blood-of-the-Skag](../../../../60-Wyrmscriber/0-Courier/Resort-Me/Blood-of-the-Skag.md).
>[!abstract] What happens if the reader uses a different variant of Skag, such as a Spitter or a baby skag? \- Devvie
>> [!quote] The recipe tastes like a horses ass. Moving on…
- One satchel of powdered Green Tea Leaf, available for purchase at any purveyor of fine Tea Leaf.

**Instructions for External Use**
1. Combine ingredients into a thick paste in a mortar and pestle
>[!quote] If any hard lumps remain, you did not process your ingredients to specification. Pour the mixture onto a flat surface and beat your head against it until the ingredients are pliable and you have learned your lesson.
>> [!abstract] That's a bit harsh isn't it? \- Devvie
>>> [!quote] … No.
1. Spread the paste over external body part of choice. Our customers routinely prefer using it on their face, shoulders, upper chest, or buttocks.
>[!quote] Please avoid use over reproductive genitalia, as it may promote shrinkage.
>>[!abstract] For women too?! \- Devvie
>>>[!quote] … Yes
1. Let the paste work its magic for up to fifteen minutes.
2. Wipe off and discard with a green cloth, or wipe off and prepare a beverage with a white cloth.

**Instructions for Brewing from Paste**
To brew without the initial drying period associated with external use, perform the following:
1. Add enough water to the paste to be able to be able to whisk with the viscosity of split pea soup.
2. Consume immediately.
3. Optional: Add the white stuff those humans always ask me about. Soy something.
>[!quote] I've heard about this almond milk. Where does almonds get the milk?

**Instructions for Brewing from White Cloth**
To brew after the paste has been dried and use as a chemical exfoliant, perform the following:
1. Place into a small pot of boiling water.
2. Wait for the water to turn split pea green.
3. Continue from Step 2 with the instructions for Brewing from a paste.

>[!quote] Before you ask me, the white cloth is enchanted to be an absorbent to the ingredients in the Matcha Latcha, and an adsorbent to everything else. I'm not a hag for nothing and take my education and concoctions seriously. Why, this human called a sci-un-test tried to tell me how my methods could not make any sense. I wonder if he could make sense that he was on our menu last week. The fool did not understand that things work differently here in the Wonderlands.
>>[!abstract] Ah Lady Jrust, we are running out of time. \- Devvie
>>>[!quote] Ah, now where was I…. oh yes, the recipe!
