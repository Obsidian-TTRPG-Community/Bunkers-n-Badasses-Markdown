## Super Badass Enemies

>[!homebrew]
> Warning: This content is a Homebrew created for Bunkers and Badasses.

Badass Enemies are dangerous foes, but Super Badasses are even deadlier; they are faster, stronger, and more murderous than regular Badass Enemies. When spawning Enemies, you can opt to spawn a Super Badass of the Enemy type by multiplying the Badass Rank by three.

For example, a Super Badass Skeleton would have a Badass Rank of 9 instead of the normal Skeleton BR of 3. 

Super Badass Enemies also have the following compared to their base counterparts:
- Triple the base Health, Armor, and Shields
- Gain Shields and Armor Equal to 1/2 Health if they did not have Shields and Armor before
- They use Actions and Mayhem Actions freely. 

Additionally, they get a two modifiers from the modifier table below, rolled at random or chosen by the BM.
