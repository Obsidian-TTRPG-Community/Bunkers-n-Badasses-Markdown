## About

Splash potions function just like regular potions, except in that you can’t use them like regular potions.  So not like regular potions. 
Instead they work like grenades. You still keep them in your potion slots, but unlike regular potions you can’t drink them, but you can Throw them, using the same rules for throwing Grenades. (You automatically hit if within your DMG Mod in squares, and beyond that you need to make an Accuracy (12) roll to get it to land where you want.)

When you Throw a Splash Potion, it splashes, (duh,) affecting everyone in the square it lands in and everyone in the adjacent squares, with the effects of the potion. Yes, that means you can accidentally heal enemies with splash health potions, or cause allies to start throwing up uncontrollably for a few turns because you used a Vomit potion.

To see if the Potion you’ve found is a traditional one, or a Splash Potion, have the player flip a coin or roll a die to determine. Heads or evens, it’s a normal Potion. Tails or odds, it’s a Splash Potion. 

Easy.

## Other Items

Turns out, there’s a variety of items that can be used in a fight to help out your Familiars as well as your allies. From Familiar Revives to necklaces that save you from death once before vanishing, these will probably be invaluable on your quest to do whatever it is you need to do. Just, remember to use them instead of hoarding them in your inventory “until you need them”. 

Items are made to be used, not written down in the “items” section of your character sheet and then forgotten for ten sessions, only to be remembered two hours after you could have used them to avoid a party wipe.

These items can be bought from shops, or found whenever a player rolls a random potion. In that case, roll a d4. On a 1, it’s one of these special items, otherwise it’s your run of the mill potion… or a splash potion. See previous entry.

 All items listed are consumables, unless otherwise noted, and occupy potion slots. Each consumable item can be used on a single Familiar as a Drink a Potion action or a Throw action. (The Familiar drinks it, not you.) Held items are items that are held by your Familiar. For balance purposes (and because most Familiars probably don’t have opposable thumbs) a Familiar can only hold 1 item at a time.

### Item Descriptions

- **DMG**+: A consumable item that, when used on a Familiar, increases its DMG Mod for the rest of the encounter, based on the item’s rarity.
- **ACC**+: A consumable item that, when used on a Familiar, increases its DMG Mod for the rest of the encounter, based on the item’s rarity.
- **Move**+: A consumable item that, when used on a Familiar, increases its Movement for the rest of the encounter, based on the item’s rarity.
- **Kibbles & Bullets**: A specially crafted blend of gunpowder, lead, and bandit chunks that is part of any Familiar’s complete diet. Usually. Heals the Familiar’s total Health, Armor, Shield, and Bone by half their total, up to their maximum.
- **Dodge Dust**: An item to be held by a Familiar, but does nothing for the Vault Hunter. (You’re too shiny and full of loot to make good use of it.) Enemies get -3 to their Accuracy Rolls to attack the Familiar holding Dodge Dust. A Familiar can only hold 1 item at a time.
- **Laser Pointer**: An item to be held by a Familiar, but does nothing for the Vault Hunter. (Your gun probably already has a laser sight, and if it doesn’t, this dinky thing isn’t gonna help it any.) A Familiar holding this gains +1 Crit Die to all their attacks. A Familiar can only hold 1 item at a time.
- **Phoneyx Feather**: A feather from the legendary Phoneyx, which allows the user to lie to Death itself just like the Phoneyx does. Using it on a dead Gained or Weapon Familiar will revive that Familiar in the space next to you at half their total Health, Armor, Shield, and Bone. Phoneyxs receive a stipend from the Brew-U corporation as part of a non-competition agreement, so their feathers don’t work on Vault Hunters. Sorry, it’s not personal, it’s just business.
- **Legend Candy**: A very Rare Candy, made from the distilled essence of Legendary loot. Feeding this to a Weapon Familiar will improve it by one tier, either increasing its Rarity up to Legendary, reroll a Legendary Weapon Familiar’s red text, or increase its Level Tier to the next available one, as though you had fed it all the loot necessary to do it the normal way. You still can’t improve a Weapon Familiar’s level tier above your own level using it, though. Even magic loot essence candies have their limits.
