> The Blackpowder Guild’s gun bonus just wasn’t up to snuff, compared to the other Guilds in the game. On many weapons, the bonus to Crit Damage only came into play 5% of the time, when you rolled a natural 20 on your Accuracy Roll to attack. To help bring these weapons up to the level of some of their competitors, the following change has been presented:

## Bonuses

| Rarity    | Bonuses                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Common    | **Calibur**: +1 Crit.             |
| Uncommon  | **Calibur**: +1 Crit. +1 ACC Mod. |
| Rare      | **Calibur**: +1 Crit. +2 ACC Mod. |
| Epic      | **Calibur**: +1 Crit. +3 ACC Mod. |
| Legendary | **Calibur**: +1 Crit. +4 ACC Mod. |

> [!note] “**Calibur**: +1 Crit” Functions just like the Dahlia “**Burst**: +1 Hit”, but instead of adding +1 Hit of Weapon Damage, it adds +1 Crit Dice to your Damage at each accuracy range.

## Overheat

> Skuldugger’s Overheat Damage was more of a penalty than a bonus, on top of a penalty since Reloading takes up the Attack Action and generates Mayhem. This change is simple. Go make those Reloads work for you, not just against you.

- Skuldugger Overheat damages the user, and everyone adjacent to them.
