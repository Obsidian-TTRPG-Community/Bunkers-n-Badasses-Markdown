The Order of the Spellshots, founded within the Wonderlands, is a venerable organization of arcanists who have mastered the art of combining the power of magic with the precision of firearms. Ordained centuries ago, the Order has always been dedicated to the protection of the realm and its people from the dangers of the Wonderlands and beyond

All Spellshots are members of the Order, and the members of the Order are known for their exceptional skill in both the arcane and the martial arts, honing their abilities to perfection through rigorous training and practice. They are adept at weaving spells and bullets together to create a seamless and deadly barrage of arcane energy. Their mastery of the arcane arts allows them to imbue their weapons with powerful enchantments, making them even more formidable in combat. One of the most notable abilities is their mastery of Polymorphism, which allows them to transform their enemies into harmless creatures such as sheep or rabbits. This ability is not only effective in battle, but it also serves as a reminder of the Spellshots' commitment to the protection of life and the preservation of the natural order.

As a Spellshot, you will be be respected, revered, and feared by the people of the realm. You will be called upon often defend it from the various magical dangers that threaten it. You  are a powerful force, but whether that force is for good or for evil is your choosing. Come, and show the world what it is you can do.
