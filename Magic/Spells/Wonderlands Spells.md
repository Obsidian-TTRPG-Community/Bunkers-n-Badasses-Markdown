> [!warning] These Rules are from a prior iteration of Scouts Rules. For the most up-to-date rules, see [[Bunkers and Badasses/Rules/Loot/Scouts Spells and Grenades|Scouts Spells and Grenades]].

Spells function like Grenades, but are more magical in nature. They take up the grenade slot and use the maximum number of Grenades to determine how many times you can cast the equipped Spell. This is similar to spell slots. When equipped, Spells transform Grenades into spell slots. Any skills, weapons, or feats that allow for throwing Grenades also allow for casting spells, and those that give Grenades back or allow for finding Grenades will also recover spell slots to allow for continuous casting.

### Manufacturers

Spells have four manufacturers that each focus on different ways to cast spells: 
- **Conjura** spells are “Simple Cast” and function like standard grenades, just point and cast. They gain bonus damage per damage die.
- **Arken** spells are “Channel Cast” and require more time before casting. Charging them up costs more spell slots, but often for much larger effects. They have a maximum number of slots you can invest in a single cast.
- **Wyrd Weaver** spells are “Repeating Cast” and can be cast multiple times at the cost of one spell slot, if you’re willing to generate a little mayhem. There’s a limit to the number of times they can Echo, though.
- **Miraculum** spells are “Self Cast” and their effects are often centered on the caster, but last longer. They all have a duration of 2 or more Turns.

### Spells

There are 10 types of spells available for players to cast, each with their own flair and magical je ne says quoi, (whatever that means,) to make your magical blasting as Badass as possible.

- **Arc Torrent** spells call down bolts of lightning on your enemies to smite them from above with Shock Damage.
- **Sigil** spells summon circles of protection around you, buffing allies and hindering foes in a wide area.
- **Eruption** spells function mostly like standard grenades, causing an explosion wherever you point that knocks back foes.
- **Fireball** spells need no introduction, they’re Fireballs. In the words of a great, and wiggly, Bardbarian: “Just use Fireball.”
- **Sunder** spells create fissures along the ground, damaging every enemy in their path, even if they’re hiding behind walls.
- **Talon** spells conjure spectral wyverns that fly around, harrying enemies. And, y’know, damaging them.
- **Hydra** spells summon Hydra Familiars that attack the nearest enemy each turn. Yes, they count as Familiars for skills.
- **Ice Spike** spells turn the battlefield into a frozen wasteland, summoning spikes and daggers of ice to freeze and murderize your enemies.
- **Barrage** spells pelt the hapless baddos with swarms of magic missiles, automatically seeking out the nearest enemies and pummeling them with arcane might.
- **Calamity** spells call down chunks of elemental hate straight from the heavens, dropping meteors teleported from low orbit directly onto some poor sap’s head. And torso. And friends. Boom.

Spells can be given Red Text if you want, in which case they don’t have to abide by any of this. Those can work however you want! Though maybe keep the Recovery and Manufacturer effects, just to make life easier on you.

## Sorcerous Recovery

Spells have a special mechanic called Sorcerous Recovery. At the start of your turn, you roll a d10. If you roll the number listed on your spell, or higher, you gain 1 Spell Slot back. The number you have to roll for your spell is determined by its Rarity.

## Spell Prefixes

Spells can have one of six prefixes that boost the spell’s performance. How the boost scales is based on the spell’s Rarity, with higher rarities getting better bonuses. Because the rarer an item is, the better it is. Makes sense, yeah?

### Spell Benefits by Rarity

|           | Recovery (d10) | Prefix Bonus (#) |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Common    | 10             | +1               |
| Uncommon  | 9+             | +2               |
| Rare      | 8+             | +3               |
| Epic      | 7+             | +4               |
| Legendary | 6+             | +5                 |
