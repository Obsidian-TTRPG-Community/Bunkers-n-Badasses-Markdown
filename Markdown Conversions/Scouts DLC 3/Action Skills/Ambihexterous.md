**(MST Mod per Day + 1/Encounter)**

Whenever you find a Grenade Mod, you can make it your Action Skill, replacing the previous Grenade Mod, if any.
- You can Toss this Grenade whenever you activate your Action Skill.
- Grenades that are your Action Skill can’t be Tossed using your Grenade Stock.
- Using your Action Skill Grenade doesn’t prevent you from attacking on your turn.
