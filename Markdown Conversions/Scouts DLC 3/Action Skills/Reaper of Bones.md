**(MST Mod per Day + 1/Encounter)**

*Become the Reaper of Bones.*
While in this form, roll an extra `dice: 2d12`(2d12) when rolling for Damage.
- The higher value is added to the attack as Damage, while the lower value is taken by you as Health Loss.
- When you would drop below 1 Health, remain at 1 Health and exit Reaper of Bones instead.
