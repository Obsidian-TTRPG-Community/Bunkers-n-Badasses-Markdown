## Kleave

The Kleave Guild is a group of skilled blacksmiths who specialize in crafting axes of all shapes and sizes. While their weapons may not have the highest base damage, they are known for their ability to score Critical hits with greater ease, often landing a Critical strike on rolls other than a natural 20.
