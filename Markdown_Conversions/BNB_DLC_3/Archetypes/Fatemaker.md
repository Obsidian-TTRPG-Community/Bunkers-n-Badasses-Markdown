# Fatemaker

>[!homebrew]
> __Warning__: This page is a Homebrew Archetype of Tiny Tina Wonderlands' Fatemaker.

Fatemakers are Badasses that often find themselves at the center of many dire-goings-on and legends-in-the-making across the world. Whether driven forth by powerful gods, ancient prophecies, or the occasional macguffin, Fatemakers know that success is a team effort.

>[!tina] Bunkermaster Tina
> And remember.... “Fate doesn’t divide us, Fate brings us Together!”

>[!dragonlord] The Dragon Lord
> "Fate "Brings Us Together"? ___She___ got that _off a fanfic_ on the ECHOnet!"
