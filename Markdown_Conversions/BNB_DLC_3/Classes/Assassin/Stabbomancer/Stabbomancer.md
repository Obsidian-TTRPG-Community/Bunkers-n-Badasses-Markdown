The Stabbomancers are a shadowy group of assassins who have mastered the art of Critical Hits and Status Effects. Hailing from various walks of life, these cunning individuals have united under a common goal: to strike from the shadows and take down their enemies with swift, precise strikes.

But the Stabbomancers are more than just skilled killers. Each member of this shadowy fraternity has entered into a pact with a spectral entity, binding themselves to the spirit of a ghost blade. These ancient beings, born of magic and mystery, grant their chosen champions the ability to unleash devastating attacks and vanish into the shadows at will.

> [!excerpt] Back Stahb, Stabbomancer
> Look, Stabbomancy isn't really its own school of magicâ€”it's a way of thinking. Specifically, "How do I stab that guy?" Up close with a dagger in the dark? A well-aimed bullet from afar? Or even an ethereal psychic ghost sword? The thing is, Stabbomancers are all about creating, and capitalizing on, opportunities. Jacks of all trades, masters of none, the skillful Stabbomancer exploits foes' weaknesses to stealthily strike vital targets to bring enemies down before they know what hit them.


Whether wielding guns, melee weapons, or magic spells, the Stabbomancers are a force to be reckoned with. Though they may be fragile, their superior speed and agility allow them to evade damage and strike their foes with lightning-fast precision. They are masters of misdirection and surprise, using their stealth and cunning to exploit the weaknesses of their enemies.
