The Graveborn are a sect of acolytes who have pledged their allegiance to the powers of Death. Often referred to as Death-touched or Necromancers, these individuals possess the ability to harness the power of the dead and manipulate it to their own ends. They are known for their proficiency in Dark Magic, and their willingness to sacrifice their own life force in order to unleash devastating attacks upon their enemies.

The origins of the Graveborn can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where they were believed to be the personal chosen of long forgotten Death gods. They were tasked with the responsibility of guiding souls to the afterlife, and were granted immense power in exchange for their service. However, as time progressed, the role of the Graveborn evolved to become one of destruction and chaos. They began to use their powers to manipulate the dead for their own gain, and were feared and shunned by the general population.

The Graveborn's abilities are rooted in the manipulation of fresh soul energy. They possess the ability to summon and control the spirits of the dead, as well as the power to sacrifice their own health in order to unleash devastating dark magic attacks. They are also accompanied by a powerful and ancient demi-lich; a being bound to their service that possesses immense magical power of its own. This demi-lich serves as both a companion and a weapon, able to cast unique spells in conjunction with the Graveborn's own abilities.

A Graveborn's ultimate goal is to attain the ultimate form of death magic, the Reaper of Bones, a phantasmal being that mantles the power of death and form of death itself. This form grants them immense power and the ability to summon hordes of undead minions. The Graveborn will stop at nothing to achieve this form, even if it means sacrificing the lives of countless others. Their methods are often seen as cruel and inhumane, but to them, the end justifies the means. They are a force to be reckoned with, and should not be underestimated.
