## Grenades: Into the Wonderlands
>[!homebrew]
> Warning: This content is a Homebrew created for Bunkers and Badasses.

Since Spells are so in-depth, it’d feel pretty bad if you were forced to compare them to the stock Grenades from the Bunkers & Badasses sourcebook, so I’m tossing in my revised Grenade and Shield generation guide as a freebie, as well as my “Always Elemental” rolling table, for use with Maliwan guns, Elemental Cloud grenades, and Talon spells.

## Generating a Grenade

### Rarity
Roll on the Gun Rarity table.

![](Rarity-Table.md#^bunkersRarity)

### Manufacturer
Then roll 1d8 for a Manufacturer and 1d4 for type. It’s worth noting that any grenade can be Elemental, not just “Elemental” grenades.

**Grenade Type:** `dice: 1d4`

| `dice: 1d8`  | Guild      | 1-2             | 3-4             |
