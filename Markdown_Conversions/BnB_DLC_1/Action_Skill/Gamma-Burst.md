# Gamma Burst

__(MST Mod per Day + 1/Encounter)__
__Special Effect:__ _Choose __1__ Familiar_

Create a _Rift_ at a target location for __2__ rounds.

When activated, the _Rift_ teleports your Familiar to its location, and empowers it for the duration:
- It deals +2 Dice on each attack and the Familiar cannot die while the _Rift_ is open.
- Enemies adjacent to the _Rift_ take `dice: 2d8` Radiation Damage when you create it, and will take `dice: 2d8` Radiation Damage if they end their turn adjacent to it.

Using __Gamma Burst__ will revive a dead Familiar.
