__My Editing Notes:__

Things in Red are skills that affect your Max HP.

Things in Orange are skills that deal with your Action Skill.

Things in Yellow are skills that boost your stats and checks.

Things in Green are skills that grant Health Regen.

Things in Blue are skills that interact with Shields.

Things in Purple are skills that deal with a recurring feature. (Agent: A specific Gadget. Beastmaster: Your chosen Familiar. Gunner: Mounted Weapons. Siren: Siren Element.)
 Skills marked with an \* Asterisk next to their name are "One-Point-Wonders" that have a max SL of 1.

__(And things in__ _ __gorgeous__ _ __hot pink, with the black highlights, and the handwriting font are comments from ya' gurl, Tina!)__

I added in the color-coded notes as a way to help track the balancing of the classes. I didn't want to give them _too much_ of certain effects, and not enough of others. As it stands, official classes usually only have 1-2 healing abilities, with 3 at the most, and any class with a +Health ability only gets 10+MST Mod/SL health with a max of 3 SL, so I tried to keep it close to that, with _Phasetrance_ Siren being the big exception. (Amara actually _does_ have multiple health-up abilities, to Moze's _none_.)

There probably are still some balance issues, but that's going to happen with any homebrew that isn't playtested to the vault and back, and I've made all these off second-hand knowledge and snippets from DeLaBamba's discord server while my book ships. (Delivery date is the same day I'm writing this.)

As I learn more about the system, how to balance homebrew, and what are _"appropriate"_ amounts of damage at each level for a Borderlands-inspired game (Where numbers often reach the "K" and "M" digits, and are designed to make you _feel_ like a Badass.) more content for Vehicles will be added, such as established vehicles like the Light Runner, Bandit Technical, and Cyclone, as well as new ones such as the seven-passenger "Party Wagon" and 'living' vehicles, like the Devils found on Gehenna. (The _actual_ Devils, not the centaur-bike version… though that too.)

Ever want to Drive a Dragon?

Until that time, I hope you enjoy the content found here, and stay tuned for future updates and additions. This is all a labor of love for the franchise and the game, and I appreciate all the comments you might have about things I've included.

Also: Feel free to check out my other B&B homebrew documents: [**Scout's B&B DLC 2**](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Q5VdQ7Ma1lfNLWEr0GwENchVsBAdVjqEbON7kbQu5Ik/edit) and [**Scout's B&B DLC 3: Into the Wonderlands**](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1MLOgrWwcLNTnP9PuXrKiLImy7SUh4hXO8arVUAlmdp0/edit)!

__Rando-Mancer__

__Class Information__

Rando-Mancers embrace the chaos of their life, turning random chance into a chain reaction of pain and suffering for everyone around them… but in a good way. Usually.

__Appearance__

Rando-Mancers are so embroiled in the chaos of their life, they don't tend to have any one sense of style or fashion. Choosing favorable outfits is kind of pointless when there's a non-zero chance your clothes could be zapped into being made of live eels on any given day. __(Or you're just Claptrap.)__

__Vehicles__

Sometimes, walking sucks. Okay, a lot of the time walking sucks. Especially when you gotta walk _really, really far_. That's why we invented the carriage! Or rode horses! Or made _cars_!

Well, as soon as we figured out how to do all that, we figured out how to _strap guns to that stuff and blow each other up with them_.

Where was I going with this? Oh! Right! Vehicles in your _ __game__ _. So! Vehicles come in all shapes and sizes, and have different amounts of people that can ride in or on 'em, in different seats that do different things. This is gonna show you how to do all that, or at least _my_ way to do it.

Firstly, Vault Hunters get a new encounter action that deals specifically with when you _aren't_ in a vehicle, but _want to be_. __(Gotta get that vroom VROOM, boi!)__

__Carjack__

If you aren't already in a vehicle, you can spend your movement to get into one that isn't being driven.

If someone _is_ driving that thing, make a Carjack Traverse Check. If you succeed, you toss that bozo out onto the ground, and deal Melee Damage to them as a parting gift. __(If you are lucky, it will part them. Part of them over here, part of them over there, you get the idea.)__

If you succeed at carjacking a car that someone is already driving, you generate 1 mayhem. If you _fail_, you generate 2 mayhem and you take Melee Damage from _them_ as they manage to hit you and stop you from jacking their ride. No mayhem for hopping in an empty ride though. __(Unless you do it too much. I'm watching you…)__

Once you're in a car, things change up a _lot_. Your encounter actions change depending on what seat you're driving, and each vehicle has different seats and armor and speeds and stuff, but they'll all follow the basic template for a vehicle, based on a combination of its Frame and Parts. Also, you can't be shot or stabbed or exploded while in a vehicle, it will take all the damage for the people driving or riding it.

__Armor__ : The amount of Armor a vehicle has. Even living vehicles have armor. A Frame will list what types of armor you can install.

__Repair__ : Functions like Health Regen or Shield Recharge, but for your ride's armor. Based on the Frame.

__Size__ : How big of a truck you're driving. Based on the Frame.~~__(And not at all indicative of the size of your various bits, I promise.)__~~

__Movement__ : How many spaces a vehicle can move each turn. Based on the Tires, Armor, and Booster.

__Boost Meter__ : The number of times your vehicle can Boost each encounter. You regain 1 charge every 3 rounds you go without Boosting, up to the vehicle's maximum.

__Seats__ : How many people can cram into or atop a ride, and what they can do there. Based on the Frame.

__Slam__ : How much damage your vehicle does when you run someone over. Based on Armor and Frame.

__Parts__ : List of available Parts you can swap out on the Frame.

__Driving__

There are three types of Seats to pilot in a vehicle: Driver, Gunner, and Passenger, each has their own list of encounter actions you can only do from your seat. ___(Note, if a vehicle lists a special action you can perform, that takes precedence over these rules.)___

__Driver (Weapon)__: You control where the vehicle goes. Each turn, you get the following encounter actions:

- __Drive__ : Move the vehicle up to its movement. Driving through an enemy's space can _Slam_ them.
- To _Slam_, roll a D20. __1__ : You miss. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_ __2-15__ : Deal the vehicle's _Slam_ damage. __16+__ : +1 Damage die. __20__ : Deal max _Slam_ damage. (_Slamming_ doesn't add ACC or DMG bonuses to rolls.)
- __Boost__ : The vehicle makes an Extra Movement. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_ If you _Slam_ while Boosting, the _Slam_ deals double damage and is Explosive.
- __Attack__ : If the Driver has a weapon listed, fire this weapon. All vehicle weapons are favored.
- __Extra Attack__ : Make an Extra Attack with the vehicle's weapon, if it has one. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_
- __Dismount__ : Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.
- __Exchange__ : Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_

__Gunner (Weapon)__: You man the vehicle's mounted turret weapon, and have the following encounter action while in the vehicle:

- __Attack__ : Attack with the vehicle's turret weapon. All vehicle weapons are favored.
- __Extra Attack__ : Make an Extra Attack with the vehicle's turret weapon. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_
- __Dismount__ : Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.
- __Exchange__ : Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_

__Passenger__ : Just along for the ride, you get to act the most freely, retaining many of your normal encounter actions. Any action that normally generates mayhem _outside_ a vehicle still generates mayhem _inside_ the vehicle.

- __Attack__ : Attack with your equipped gun, or Melee Attack someone adjacent to your seat.
- __Extra Attack__ : Make an Extra Attack.
- __Grenade__ : Toss a Grenade.
- __Throw__ : Throw an item to someone, inside or outside the vehicle doesn't matter.
- __Drink a Potion__ : Take a sip, babes.
- __Swap Guns__ : Switch between active guns.
- __Reload__ : Trigger reload effects.
- __Dismount__ : Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.
- __Exchange__ : Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. _(Generates 1 mayhem.)_

Being inside a vehicle isn't all fun and games. __(Tho it should be!)__ When a vehicle's Armor reaches 0 (Zero), it ~~breaks.~~ __explodes.__ Anyone inside the vehicle __, or next to it, takes its Slam damage as it blows up and__ lands in a space they previously occupied while in the vehicle. __(If the vehicle was a living creature, it still explodes. Fantasy, amirite?)__

__Extra Large Vehicles__

Some vehicles aren't just big, they're hella big. Like, maybe have rooms and stuff big. Vehicles like this still have seats, maybe a _lot_ of seats, but they are also big enough to be a battle map where if you aren't in a seat you can walk around and do stuff like normal. Think like… big boats and trains. Like a pirate ship. Or a moving castle. Vehicles big enough to be maps don't usually have __Armor__ or __Repair__ traits, since they're more set pieces than actual vehicles, they're so big it'd take a stupid amount of damage to destroy them. __(But you can totally give them stupid big numbers if you want your players or baddos to blow 'em up. I'll not only allow it, I encourage it! BURN ALL THE BABIES!!!)__

__Vehicle Parts__

Vehicles are somewhat customizable. While you can't turn one vehicle Frame into another, you can swap out some parts from one vehicle Frame to another Frame, changing its stats, its weapons, and even giving it special abilities. There are ~~four~~ __Five__ types of Parts available.

- __Armor__ : The vehicle's frame and plating. Affects Armor, Boost Meter, Movement, and Slam. There are four types of armor: Ultralight, Light, Heavy, and Ultraheavy.
- __Booster__ : The vehicle's engine. Affects Boost Meter, Movement, and Slam.
- __Tires__ : The vehicle's wheels. Affects Boost Meter and Movement. Come in Mono, Duo, Quad, and Tread. __(Run them all over!)__
- __Weapon__ : Your vehicle's weapons. Come in two flavors: Light, and Heavy. These parts don't change how your vehicle handles, just how it hurts. __(Unless you want it to, boo. It's your game!)__
- __(Cosmetics!: Make it look nice! These add to the Badassery stat. If you got a dope ride people will respect you. Or maybe try to jack it. I dunno.)__

You can modify any of your vehicle's Parts at a garage, but you can only change their Parts once per Pan'Dorahn day. If your vehicle is destroyed, you can summon a new one from a Catch-A-Chariot station for 10% of your Gold.

__Damage Progression__

As you increase in levels, the damage dealt by your vehicles will increase as well. They'll always hit _ __just__ _ harder than you, but the tradeoff is that you can't take them everywhere. Eventually, you have to hoof it. Vehicle Slam and Weapon Damage follows a basic Damage Progression. Weapons have a base amount of damage dice they roll, and certain parts can increase or decrease that Progression. Whenever you reach a new Level Milestone, increase the Progression by one.

Milestones: Level __7__ , Level __13__ , Level __19__ , Level __25__.

The following are just examples of vehicles you can find or make, and are by no means an extensive list of things you can build, drive, and/or steal. What do I look like to you, someone who knows what an engine looks like? Someone who knows all the different breeds of car? I'm writing a book about imaginary murder and magic and magical murder. For _nerds_. Get off my back.

__Frames__

Frames are what type of vehicle you're driving, and determine its base stats and what parts can be swapped out at a garage. ___(All vehicles can have as many cosmetics as you want. 'Cuz I said so. But, like, only one of each one. You can't have, like,___ _ __two__ _ ___hood ornaments. That's dumb. And tacky.)___

_Beast Cart_

__Base Armor__ : 50

__Armor__ : Any

__Repair__ : 10

__Size__ : 2x3 squares

__Tires__ : Quad

__Boost Meter__ : 2 (_Beasts_)

__Seats__ : Driver (_Beast_), Seats (x4)

__Base Slam__ : 1d8

__Parts__ : Armor (x1), Tires, Booster (_Beasts_ x2)

__Special__ : The Beast Cart is drawn by two Beasts (Usually Skags, but maybe horses, or dragons if you're a badass,) that act as _Basic Engines,_ but also act as Driver Weapons. The Driver can make Attack actions using the Beast's Attacks. You can swap out Beasts like you would normal boosters, and they grant any special movement they have to the Cart. (Yes, Dragons would make your cart fly. No, it doesn't make sense, but it's awesome, so I'm putting it in. What, you gonna complain? About my game full of magic and dragons and wands that are not explicitly but heavily implied to be guns?) (If your ride goes BOOM, the Beasts explode too! But don't worry, they'll come back along with your ride whenever you use a Catch-A-Chariot station, just like the cart.)

__Special__ : Pandoracorns are exceedingly rare. And getting one to let you ride it is even rarer. Riding one costs 1 Badass Token for each hour you ride it, and you can't respawn one that dies at a Catch-a-Chariot station. Also if you let one die, others might not be super happy to let you ride them in the future, so be careful.
