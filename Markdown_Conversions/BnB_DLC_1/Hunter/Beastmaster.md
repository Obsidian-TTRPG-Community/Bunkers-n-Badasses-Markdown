## Action Skill
***Gamma Burst***
**(MST Mod per Day + 1/Encounter)**
**Special Effect:** *Choose **1** Familiar*

Create a *Rift* at a target location for **2** rounds.

When activated, the *Rift* teleports your Familiar to its location, and empowers it for the duration:
- It deals +2 Dice on each attack and the Familiar cannot die while the *Rift* is open.
- Enemies adjacent to the *Rift* take `dice: 2d8` Radiation Damage when you create it, and will take `dice: 2d8` Radiation Damage if they end their turn adjacent to it.

Using **Gamma Burst** will revive a dead Familiar.
