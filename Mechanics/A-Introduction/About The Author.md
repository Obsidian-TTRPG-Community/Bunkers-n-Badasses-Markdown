I’M MS. GRAYGAX PERENNIA DARNESON -- call me “Gray” for short -- and I am a firm believer in two things:
1. Friendship and social interaction are the most important things in all of human existence
2. Friendship and social interaction are difficult and they suck and I don’t like them at all

Now, some of you extroverts will read that and be like, “what’s so hard about social interaction? You just hang out. It’s easy.”

Which, sure. It’s “easy.” For you, maybe. Have fun going to parties and talking and having sex with people, you psychopath.

The rest of us -- for whom average conversations are like walking a tightrope over two separate pits of flesh-eating skags, one of which is labeled “making yourself look stupid” and the other “offending the other person” -- need a little help when it comes to being around the people we actually enjoy being around.

That’s why I created Bunkers & Badasses -- to provide a safe, fun way to hang out with your friends and create a story together.

I also like murdering imaginary orcs. So there’s a lot of imaginary orc-murder in here, too.

I created the B&B system when I was supposed to be filing collateral damage reports for the Frontline Paperwork Division of the Atlas Crimson Lance. I was sick of reading about real-life death and destruction, and figured escaping into a world of fantastical death and destruction might calm my nerves somewhat.

Once my rank-and-file Lancemen coworkers decided to take a brief intermission from mercilessly bullying me, I managed to convince them to sit down for a brief one-shot. Over the course of a couple hours, I watched in awe as these gruff, armored, masked killersfor-hire lost themselves in a world of dice rolls, character sheets, and borderline-copyright-infringing fantasy tropes.

From that day forward, I was happy to call the elite soldiers of the Crimson Lance not just my coworkers, but my friends. One such friend, Alphonso Knoxx, suggested I turn my homebrewed fantasy system into a proper product. And now, five years and a hundred thousand imaginary dead orcs later, you are holding the fruits of those labors: the first edition of Bunkers & Badasses.

I hope you dig it. And if you don’t you’re probably an extrovert and we’ll never meet anyway.
