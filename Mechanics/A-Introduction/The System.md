## Overview

BUNKERS & BADASSES is a TableTop Role Playing Game (TTRPG). One player will take on the role of the Bunker Master (==BM)== <span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">nice</span>. The other players are the adventurers, the Vault Hunters. Together, all will venture forth through Pan’Dorah and beyond, on a ==never ending campaign of hilarity, shooting, and looting==.
<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">until one of your players cancels two sessions in a row and the entire group slowly falls apart</span>
<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">LOOKING AT</span>
<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">YOU LILITH</span>

During a session of Bunkers & Badasses you will need:

> [!echodesc] 
> ***CHARACTER SHEETS***
> Each Vault Hunter will have a Character Sheet to record stats and information about their individual character.
>
> ***PAPER***
> Good for taking notes.
>
> ***WRITING IMPLEMENTS*** 
> Notes are easier to take with one of these.
> 
> ***DICE***
> For rolling and cursing.

Bunkers & Badasses uses polyhedral dice to determine the outcomes of variables in the game. The seven different dice that are used in the game are labeled based on the number of sides they have: ==d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20==. Percentiles use the d10 and a second d10 that has values in the 10’s (10, 20, 30, etc) and are used to generate a number between 1-100.

The game rules or the BM will tell you how many dice to roll and when to roll them during the game.

## The Bunker Master

Each game of Bunkers & Badasses will be helmed by a Bunker Master. The Bunker Master has one job, and one job only: to make sure the players have fun.

“But what about the rules? A game system is nothing without its rules!” 

What are you, a cop?  

If your players are having fun, you’re a good Bunker Master.

Period. The end. Full stop. I made the rules, and I’m telling you to ignore them if it works better with your player group. No two groups are the same, and a lot of your job is about finding out what your specific players enjoy doing, and what they find tedious. Then, do your best to include a lot of the former and none of the latter.

Some of that means interpreting and enforcing the rules, yes. Some of that means determining when you should go easy on your players, and when you should ratchet up the tension and difficulty so they start to get worried.

But again, more than anything else: it’s about making sure the other players have fun.

> [!echodesc] The Role of the BM?
> To play Bunkers & Badasses is to tell a story. That story is told by the players (your Vault Hunters), fate itself (the dice), and the Bunker Master (you).
> 
> You’re going to create situations for your players to deal with, and then they’re going to deal with them in whatever way they see fit, so long as it fits within the bounds of the kind of play you want to encourage.
> 
> You’re going to spend a couple hours designing puzzles and creatures and locations, and then your players are going to ignore all that and spend three hours trying to protect a funny-voiced Non-Player Character (NPC) gnome you created out of thin air when your players demanded to know who else was sitting around in their starting tavern, and you panicked and went “Gnomedaddy the Gnome.”
> 
> If the session goes great and everybody has fun, you’re the one to thank. If the session goes poorly and everyone ends up feeling bored, it’s your fault.
> 
> But no pressure! If this is your first time running a tabletop game, make sure you’ve got patient, understanding friends. If your friends are NOT patient and understanding, get new friends.
> 
> As Bunker Master, you’ll want to read this entire book and familiarize yourself with the rules. You do NOT have to have the entire book memorized. Just the broad strokes of how combat works and stuff. If you’re ever confused about a rule, it’s okay to ask everyone to give you a few minutes to flip through the book and find the relevant rule. This is also a good reason to bring snacks to any roleplay session, so your players can distract themselves with caloric intake while you rifle through the pages of this book.
> 
> Anyway: learn the rules, break the rules, encourage your friends, have fun, try not to worry too much.

## The Vault Hunters

Vault Hunters are badasses who shoot stuff and collect stuff from the stuff they’ve shot. Each player in your game will create and embody their own Vault Hunter, taking them on adventures and doing massively irresponsible stuff with them.

Each Vault Hunter will be distinct from any other Vault Hunter through a combination of their skills, abilities, stats, loot, and a buncha other stuff.

> [!echodesc] The Role of the Player
> The player’s job is to be badass. That’s it.
> 
> The player should feel comfortable to take risks. To come up with ideas that are just stupid enough to work. To try out stupid ideas just because they feel like they’d be fun, or funny, or weird, or badass.
> 
> Really, their goal is to have fun.

## Unique Mechanics

What makes Bunkers & Badasses different from other RPGs on Pandora? Well, unlike Vaultfinder from D-fault Dice or the recent release from Claptastic Labs, The Rapper’s Chronicles; Bunkers & Badasses has several super unique, one of a kind, amazingly awesome game mechanics. Who doesn’t love learning new mechanics?

### The Badass System

When standard Attack moves simply aren’t enough and a situation calls for some serious out-of-the-box solutions, the Badass System can be a saving grace. This is where players can really test the limits of the game and the BM. Where they can stretch, bend, and break the rules and get rewarded for their efforts. (More on the Badass System starting on page 75.)

<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">Lemme hitchu with some examples of stuff that’s badass enough and stuff that ain't</span>
**Not Badass Enough**
- <span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">“Roland moves to Cover and shoots his rifle at a guy”</span>
- <span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">“Lilith throws a grenade and the explosion is really big”</span>
- <span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">“Krieg does his taxes”</span>

### Mayhem! Mayhem! Mayhem

What is an RPG looter shooter without a little Mayhem? As Vault Hunters adventure, explore, and battle they will be generating Mayhem Points which acts like a currency; a currency that the BM can use to create a little havoc back. There are various ways Mayhem Points are created, both in and out of combat, which the BM can spend to implement greater challenges in combat. See more on Mayhem on page 66.

### Keeping It Cool

There are two main steps that the BM can take to make sure everyone is keeping it cool.

First, talk briefly about any topics that players may want to avoid in the game. If a player says that they want something to be avoided in the game, this is not a time to discuss why or try to change their mind. Accommodate their request and move on. Keep it cool.

Second is the Naw, Dawg rule. If something comes up during the game that the group agreed to avoid or if something makes a player uncomfortable in any way, a player can declare “naw, dawg” at any time. When this happens, the person speaking should either rewind or immediately go in a different direction. Remember, keeping it cool means you don’t ask WHY someone wants to move on from a topic: just keep the game going and everyone will have fun.

## How To Use This Book

This book is separated into three parts; **Creating a Character**, **Playing the Game**, and **Running the Game**. In the Creating a Character section, players will be taken through the steps of creating a new Vault Hunter all the way from soup to nuts, as they say. Playing the Game includes information helpful for both players and the BM before starting on an adventure. Running the Game has guidance and tools to aid the BM, whether running a premade adventure or creating a new campaign.

**Badass Enough**

She throws a grenade at the tangled bodies and turns away just before it explodes.”</span>
