PAN’DORAH IS much like the real world in which we all live: death is plentiful, loot even more so, and only the strongest and/or most insane will survive. Both Pan’Dorah and the real world are filled with dangerous beasties, powerful guns, courageous Vault Hunters, and epic quests.

The main difference between Pan’Dorah and our world is that Pan’Dorah has, like, elves.

Every fantasy trope you’ve ever seen; every wizarding spell; every fantastical beast; you can find them all on Pan’Dorah, and then you can shoot them in the face.

But worry not, skeptical adventurers: the world of Pan’Dorah is not merely a carbon copy of those classic cliches you’ve seen a thousand times. The creatures and locales of Pan’Dorah have a unique, Pandoran twist. What might have been a mere bandit on Pandora is now a spell-slinging brigand in the fantastical realm of Pan’Dorah. He may use magic, but he’ll still scream about riding your corpse like a meat bicycle.

And guns? Yes, the world of Pan’Dorah has guns, but they’re not just guns -- they’re magical wands that fire small pieces of metal at extremely high velocities. And they’ve got different firing rates and ideal ranges. And they need to be reloaded. And they look like guns.

Okay, the guns are basically the same. But everything else has a fresh coat of blood on it. Within these pages, you’ll find the result of grabbing the brutal, gleefully insane world of Pandora in one hand, and a magical world of fantasy in the other, and then making them kiss one another.
