## Understanding Stats

Choosing how to allocate the four main stat points shapes the character and play style of each unique Vault Hunter. Adding points to stats will have direct and indirect effects on a range of gameplay elements including encounters, Checks, and Skill Tree efficacy.

> [!echodesc] Stat Types
> **ACCURACY (ACC)**  
> Accuracy refers to your ability to Hit a specific target when aiming. The Accuracy stat is applied several different ways throughout play. The most obvious way is in combat. More Accuracy, more Hits. That includes anything you might Throw, like grenades, Barrels, or your shoe. Accuracy stats also influence both Insight and Interact Checks.
> 
> **DAMAGE (DMG)**  
> Damage is an easy stat to understand as it only applies to combat and Throw distance. How much hurt can you rain down on your Enemies and how far can you hurl that hurt.
> 
> **SPEED (SPD)**  
> Speed represents both how fast you can move, which matters a great deal when dodging Enemy Attacks, and how far. By default, you can move 3 squares per turn. Any addition to the Speed stat increases Movement Range. Speed is also applied when rolling Initiative and for Traverse and Talk Checks.
> 
> **MASTERY (MST)**  
> Mastery is the focus and proficiency you bring to certain Skills. Each Vault Hunter has a specific Action Skill that can be used once per encounter by default.
> 
> Increasing Mastery allows for more frequent Action Skill opportunities. It also improves Sneak and Search Checks and influences Health gains.

### Choose an Archetype

There are many types of badasses in the world. Shooty badasses. Flamey badasses. Explodey badasses.

Choosing an **Archetype** and **Class** is your opportunity to decide which type of badass you’d like to be.

The four Archetypes are **Deadeye**, **Elementalist**, **Enforcer**, and **Guardian**. Enforcers do a lot of Damage; Elementalists focus on their Action Skill; Deadeyes don’t miss; and Guardians never stop moving.

Archetypes are found starting on page 20. While choosing an Archetype, also read through the various **Archetype Feats** and select one for your chosen Archetype. Some Feats may have requirements that must be met before that Feat can be selected. Write the selected Archetype on the Character Sheet in the "Archetype" section, and write the value of each stat in the corresponding stat box. Then, write the Archetype Feat in the "Skills and Feats" section (at Level 5 there will be an opportunity to learn a second Archetype).

**Archetype Starting Stats**

| Archetype | Accuracy | Damage | Speed | Mastery |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ------- |
| Enforcer  | 1        | 4      | 2     | 0       |
| Elemental | 0        | 2      | 1     | 4       |
| Deadeye   | 4        | 1      | 0     | 2       |
| Guardian  | 2        | 0      | 4     | 1       |

### Choose a Class

What’s your hero fantasy? Maybe you’re a dual-wielding madman, cackling with delight as your casings hit the ground. Or maybe you’re a precise, mysterious killer for hire. Regardless of your choice, your Class is how you embody your particular power fantasy.

Bunkers & Badasses features nine Classes, and each has a Skill Tree that is unique to their Class. Want to use fists to forcibly remove the “Un” from “Undead”? The Berserker could be right for you. Want a mech<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">*</span> who can punch and mow down spiderants? Mechromancer has you covered. Whatever your taste in destruction, there is a Class where you will thrive. <span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">like a normal robot, but</span> 
<span style="color: hotpink; font-family: 'Gil Sans', sans-serif;">* * * * fantasy * * * *</span>

The nine Classes are: **Assassin**, **Berserker**, **Commando**, **Gunzerker**, **Hunter**, **Mechromancer**, **Psycho**, **Siren**, and **Soldier**. More info on Classes start on page 28; after selecting one, write the Class name on the Character Sheet.

### Class Features

Each Class has specific features to choose from for even greater customization. Class features include Stat Modifiers, Favored Gun, Melee Die, Action Skill, Background, and Skill Tree.

#### A. Stat Increases

Each Class grants the Vault Hunter a single bonus to three of their four stats. Once a Class is selected, corresponding stats should be added to the Character Sheet.

**Stat Increases By Class**

| Class             | Accuracy | Damage | Speed | Mastery |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ------- |
| Assassin          | +2       | 0      | +1    | +1      |
| Berserker         | 0        | +2     | +1    | +1      |
| Commando          | +1       | +1     | 0     | +2      |
| Gunzerker         | +1       | +2     | 0     | +1      |

| Soldier           | +1       | 0      | +1    | +2      |

#### B. Action Skill

An **Action Skill** is a special ability that a Vault Hunter can perform once per encounter and an additional number of times per Pan’Dorah day based on their Mastery Modifier (MST Mod). For example, a player with a 3 MST Mod can use their Action Skill once in every encounter and then use it again up to 3 times per day. They can even use all 3 extra Action Skills in the same encounter if they are crazy like that. Most Action Skills allow a player to perform special Attacks or maneuvers that give a powerful edge during an encounter (or when showing off). Write the name and description of the Action Skill on your Character Sheet in the section provided. Additional notes for your Action Skill can be placed into the “Familiar/Action Skill Notes” section, including total Damage in the box labeled “Damage” to the right of the section.

#### C. Favored Vs. Non-Favored Gun

Each Class has one gun they prefer over all others. The kind they sleep next to (or with [not like that]) every night. We call this particular type of gun the Vault Hunter’s Favored Gun. When making a Ranged Attack with a Favored Gun, Vault Hunters add their ACC and DMG Mods to their respective rolls (Accuracy Roll and Damage Roll). Players can also gain additional Favored Gun types from Level Up rewards found in their Archetype Trees. Each Class has a choice of 2 Favored Guns at the start but more options become available through Leveling Up. There is a spot on the Character Sheet to fill in Favored Gun type. Non-Favored Guns are fun too, and should not be discounted. They just don’t have the stat bonuses. Sometimes you want to shoot a Rocket Launcher, but that doesn’t mean you want to make it your BFF.

#### D. Skill Tree

Okay, so -- this part is gonna look complicated, but it’s not as scary as it seems.

Each Class has its own specific Skill Tree. As play progresses, the player will be able to unlock more and more cool stuff in their Skill Tree. Each Skill Tree has a few sections: Class Name, Skill Tree Name, Skill Tiers, and Skills. At Level 1, the first Skill Point (SP) can only be placed in a tier 1 Skill. 3 Skill Points are needed in a tier to unlock the next tier. The Skill Level (SL) of a Skill is based on how many Skill Points have been placed into a certain Skill.

#### E. Melee Die

When feeling the desire to punch something, either (A) seek therapy, or (B) bring out the **Melee Die**. Melee Attacks in Bunkers & Badasses usually Hit simply due to proximity, but there is a chance to miss or possibly deal even more Damage. Each Class has a Melee Die listed in their Class Features. When creating a Vault Hunter, write down the die type in the "Melee Die" box provided on the Character Sheet.

#### F. Background

There are a range of Backgrounds to choose from for each Class, listed on the Class pages. Each Background gives a glimpse at what life was like before becoming a Vault Hunter, and grants some bonuses and penalties based on past adventures. Once a Background is selected, it can be written in the "Backgrounds" section on the back of the Character Sheet. Note whether the Background modifies any stats.

### Traits

Each Vault Hunter gets two Traits, one chosen and one rolled, using two d10s (one with tens values). Each player gets one reroll. Write the two Traits on the back of the Character Sheet in the section marked “Traits”; feel free to embellish. Include the Checks bonus that the Trait provides. Possibly mark that Check with an asterisk as a reminder of the special bonus.

### Calculate Base Stats and Modifiers

To calculate Base Stats, combine Archetype Stats + Class Stats + Background Stats. Take an additional 3 points and add them to any desired stat; either all in 1 or spread amongst a few. Write in the total Base Stat in the corresponding stat box on the Character Sheet.

To calculate Modifiers (Mod), simply divide each Base Stat in half, rounding down when the Base Stat is an odd number. Write each modifier number in the smaller box.

| Accuracy | ACC | Damage | DMG | Speed | SPD | Mastery | MST |
| -------- | --- | ------ | --- | ----- | --- | ------- | --- |
| 4        | +2  | 2      | +1  | 3     | +1  | 4       | +2    |
