> [!warning]
> If some party members wanted to Spare and Some wanted to destroy, hold off on starting this quest just yet.

Throughout the Wonderlands campaign, a sharp-eyed adventurer may observe that there are more than Goblins,  GOB-lins, and Humans who make their home within the Wonderlands; the Undead do as well. Those whom are raised but do not actively fight for the Dragon Lord unless actively called upon. For the most part, their Lord lets them unlive out their undead unlives in peace. 

When your Players are tasked by the Diamonguard to destroy one of these settlements in [Them or Us](Them%20or%20Us.md), your players must make a choice: Destroy or Spare this undead settlement. In this case, your players choose to spare the settlement. 

This is what happens to your Graveborn and Blightcaller classes as a result.

> It may take some convincing to have the player follow this strange, hooded mage with shifty eyes. Either way, the mage will do whatever it takes to convince the Fatemaker to follow them, except debauchery; they have standards.

> Once the Fatemaker is led to Alchemy Lab area of Queen's Gate, which is full of humans and skeletons, that is when an "old" friend will reintroduce themselves to them- Ribula. This time he's not angrily throwing lightballs and instead is trying to grovel at the Fatemaker's feet instead. The Fatemaker can respond however they wish. Ribula is a true masochist at heart.

> Once the Fatemaker finally asks what the fuck is going on, then Ribula will Introduce the Order of the Horned Skull, a group of necromancers who operate in secret because of persecution for their use of such magic. If asked about what type of persecutions, a nearby human will interrupt Ribula before he can explain and state that they are forced to recite Vatu language if caught doing necromantic magic. If the player is still unaware of this effect, explain its soul/body dematerializing properties.
> Furthermore he will explain, rather seriously, that the Fatemaker's actions at Mouldy Hill were unheard of.

You've already seen but a small taste of what happens when you fall outside *her* chosen narrative." The skeleton seemed to frown. "It will only get worse. I brought you here to ask you to consider your situation; that you have been and are on the wrong side. I also brought you here to give you some tools to keep you safe while you think about your current fate. No strings attached. Call it a gesture of good will from a Lord to his subjects. Should you choose to move further along this path, you need only seek Ribula out again." The skeleton closed its eyes and shuddered. "That never gets easier." The voice returned to normal, the Dragon Lord was gone.

I suggest you let us show you how to properly raise humanoid creatures and seawargs, The master may have imparted the raw knowledge but.. he is not a human and I am afraid the knowledge does not transfer as seamlessly as it appears."

> Should the Fatemaker choose to stay, they will stay for a day and gain instruction and mastery in raising basic humanoids and seawargs. Enjoy your educational roleplay montague. Their casts will never fail as long as the BR of the being is below the level or BR of the player.
> Should the Fatemaker go without staying for education, their casts may fail unless the BR of the being is 2 or more levels below the player. Furthermore, the undead has a rare chance of turning on them.

If the player decides they want to seek out Ribula again, begin next quest.

> Raising dead dragons is the pinnacle of any necromancers power. However, to learn that ability can be hard for the living indeed. It requires undeniable proof of putting the needs of the undead above the needs of the living. And currently the only one who can teach any tenacious living necromancer to raise undead of this magnitude is the Dragon Lord. Like the dragon that he represents, he guards his secrets carefully.

## BM Explanation
Throughout the Wonderlands campaign, a sharp-eyed adventurer may observe that there are more than Goblins,  GOB-lins, and Humans who make their home within the Wonderlands; the Undead do as well. Those whom are raised but do not actively fight for the Dragon Lord unless actively called upon. For the most part, their Lord lets them unlive out their undead unlives in peace.

When your Players are tasked by the Diamonguard to destroy one of these settlements in [Them or Us](Them%20or%20Us.md), your players must make a choice: Destroy or Spare this undead settlement. Should they choose to spare the undead village, the Graveborn and Blightcaller players are later approached by the human members of the [Order of the Horned Skull](Order%20of%20the%20Horned%20Skull). They are offered an olive branch by a representative of the Dragon Lord; the secrets of necromancy in exchange for consideration that perhaps the players are currently misled, and on the wrong side.

Should that path continue, and the conversations, revelations (or machinations- its your choice) continue between Dragon Lord and player, the
