# Obsidian Bunkers and Badasses Resource Repository
A repository of resources the TTRPG game Bunkers and Badasses by [Nerdvana Games](https://nerdvanagames.com), primarily oriented towards utilization within [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

## TTRPG Statblocks Layout
A layout to integrate the familiar Bunkers & Badasses statblock with [Obsidian TTRPG Statblocks](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-5e-statblocks).
Version 1 focuses on mimicking the "normal" monster statblock.

A 2nd and 3rd version will be added to allow for the statblock coloration we have seen for bosses in the campaigns. However, boss functionality is available in Version 1.

Please ensure that you read the [Layout Readme](TTRPG_Statblocks/Bestiary/BnB-Statblock-Readme.md) for details on how to use some functions.

### WIP
The WIP or Works-in-Progress folder in different sections, contain currently in-testing modules. Use them at your own risk. However, if you do use them and have feedback, I'd love to know!
