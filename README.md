# Obsidian-Bunkers-n-Badasses

A repository for resources for resources for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and the TTRPG game Bunkers &amp; Badasses.

## TTRPG Statblocks Layout

A layout to integrate the familiar Bunkers & Badasses statblock with [Obsidian TTRPG Statblocks](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-5e-statblocks). Version 1 focuses on mimicking the "normal" monster statblock. A 2nd and 3rd version will be added to allow for the statblock coloration we have seen for bosses in the campaigns. However, boss functionality is available in Version 1. Please ensure that you read the [Layout Readme](https://github.com/sigrunixia/Obsidian-Bunkers-n-Badasses/blob/main/TTRPG-Statblocks/BnB-Statblock-Readme.md) for details on how to use some functions.
