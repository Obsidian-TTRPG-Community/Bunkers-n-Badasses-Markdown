> **Archetype**:: [[Affinity of the Siren]]
> **Details**:: When the Siren would otherwise receive a killing blow, they enter Fight for their Life. For 1 turn per 10 Levels, the Siren can continue their normal combat actions. If they achieve a killing blow, or are given aid by another player, they are restored to `dice: 1d20`(+ Max HP Modifier) HP and Shields. This ability can only be used once per encounter. At level 10, the Die is increased to a `dice: 2d20`(+ Max HP Modifier). At level 20, the Die is increased to a `dice: 3d20`(+ Max HP Modifier). At 25, the Die is increased to a `dice: 4d20` (+ Max HP Modifier).
