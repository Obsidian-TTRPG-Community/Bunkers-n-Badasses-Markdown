> [!quote] Scout's Words of Wisdom
> Since Spells are so in-depth, it’d feel pretty bad if you were forced to compare them to the stock Grenades from the Bunkers & Badasses sourcebook, so I’m tossing in my revised Grenade and Shield generation guide as a freebie, as well as my “Always Elemental” rolling table, for use with Maliwan guns, Elemental Cloud grenades, and Talon spells.

## Generating a Grenade

### Rarity

Roll on the Gun Rarity table.

### Manufacturer

Then roll 1d8 for a Manufacturer and 1d4 for type. It’s worth noting that any grenade can be Elemental, not just “Elemental” grenades.
