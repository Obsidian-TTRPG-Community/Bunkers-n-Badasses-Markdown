Melee weapons are special, equipable weapons that augment your Melee Attacks. They don’t occupy a Gun Slot, but you can only have one equipped at a time.

Melee Weapons have four manufacturers: [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Valora|Valora]], [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Swifft|Swifft]], [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Kleave|Kleave]], and [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative BONK!|BONK!]], and each manufacturer provides their own bonus available on all their weapons. 

>[!quote] A Word from Scout
> You can opt out of using a Melee Weapon on your Melee Attack at any time, no action needed! This is in case your Melee adds an element that your foe might be resistant or immune to! When all else fails, you’ve got your fists!

## Generate a Melee Weapon

Roll on the Gun Rarity table on page 81 of the _Bunkers & Badasses_ sourcebook, then roll a d4 for Manufacturer. 

| `dice: 1d4` | Manufacturer |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative BONK!\|BONK!]]        |
| 2           | [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Kleave\|Kleave]]       |
| 3           | [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Swifft\|Swifft]]       |
| 4           | [[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Guilds/Alternative Valora\|Valora]]             |


Only Uncommon or higher rarity Melee Weapons have prefixes, roll a d20 to determine what it is.

![[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Prefixes and Red Text/Wonderlands Prefixes#^BnB-Scouts-Prefixes-Wonderlands-Melee|Wonderlands Prefixes]]

Additionally, Melee Weapons can be given Red Text, granting them special abilities, or increasing the ones from their manufacturer beyond their normal limits. Go wild with it!


## Melee Weapons with Elements

Melee weapons with Elements can add that element to all Melee Damage you deal, even if it’s not a Melee Attack.
