Spells and Grenades function very similarly. They both use your Grenade Stock, and you have to Throw them to bring their various flavors of pain.

Grenades are a bit more uniform in their construction, being somewhat mass produced from various Payloads and parts. This leads all Grenades to function in more or less similar ways. Every Proximity Grenade will explode when an enemy moves adjacent, and every MIRV drops mini-Grenades when it detonates. The fun is in the combinations of effects you can find.

Spells are a bit crazier. Each Spell Manufacturer makes each kind of Spell, but they all put their own spin on them. While two types of spell may fall under the same category, they won’t act the same. If you do find a copy of the Spell you have equipped, there should still be *something* different enough about it to mix it up at least a little bit.

Any skills, weapons, or feats that reference tossing a Grenade also ‘see’ you casting Spells. Magic is cool like that.

Whenever you find a Grenade, it has a chance of being a Spell instead! To find out, simply roll any die. If the result is Even, it’s a Grenade. If it’s Odd, you found a Spell! Simple, really. From there, each item’s generation is detailed below.

## Prefixes

Prefixes are shared between both Grenades *and* Spells, and their effects scale with the item’s rarity instead of its level. 

Sometimes it’ll be beneficial to keep a high-rarity, low-level Item with a useful Prefix, and other times you can probably toss out the old one for a new one that deals more damage or has a better damage type. It’s all up to you!

## Grenades

Grenades now have four manufacturers that make the core Delivery Method for your grenade:

- **Torgue** Lobbed Grenades are the most basic of basic. You throw them, they explode. What more could you ask for? Sometimes, all you need in life is the simplicity of an Explosion.
- **Alas!** Homing Grenades don’t care how bad your aim is. Let ‘em loose and they’ll hunt down the nearest enemy and blow them to kingdom come, no Accuracy Roll needed!
- **Hyperius** Longbow Grenades are for when you want to take out someone *really* far away, probably behind a wall. For these, your Throw Range is essentially “Can you see them?”
- **Pangoblin** Proximity Grenades are for the cautious types who don’t want enemies getting too close. Or the paranoid types who like to set lots of traps. Set ‘em down and sit back, they’ll take care of the rest.

On top of that, there are twenty different Payloads your Grenades can use to rain explosive torment on your foes. Higher level Grenades will mix-and-match these, too! Teleporting Money Nukes! Proximity Healing MIRVs! The world is your blood-soaked oyster.

- **Artillery** Grenades “Detonate” in a spray of bullets in each adjacent square for 2 turns.
- **Bouncy** Grenades ricochet around, bouncing 3 times and Detonating on each bounce.
- **Critical** Grenades *Hurt*. They get bonus Critical Damage.
- **Divider** Grenades split when Thrown, causing extra Grenades to land in the square you throw them at.
- **Elemental Damage** Grenades are always Elemental, and deal bonus Elemental Damage to boot.
- **Elemental Cloud** Grenades spawn clouds of elemental damage that linger for a few turns to damage foes.
- **Force** Grenades have stronger blasts, granting them an increased chance to knockback.
- **Generator** Grenades recover your shields when they damage enemies.
- **Jumping** Grenades hop about when thrown, Detonating twice in the same turn.
- **Large** Grenades have bigger effects, exploding in a larger radius.
- **Link** Grenades deal bonus Damage the more enemies get caught in their blast. The more, the murder-ier!
- **MIRV** Grenades are like Grenade Piñatas! When they go off, they drop more Grenades in adjacent squares. Fun at parties.
- **Nuke** Grenades consume extra Grenades when Thrown, the tradeoff being a ***much*** stronger explosion.
- **Rain** Grenades pop up into the air on Detonation, causing damage below them over several turns.
- **Roider** Grenades just pack more of a punch, dealing more base damage than Grenades of a similar level.
- **Singularity** Grenades pull enemies towards them before they explode, like a tiny black hole.
- **Splash** Grenades are splashier than other Grenades, causing their Splash Damage to deal more damage.
- **Transfusion** Grenades recover your health when they Damage Enemies.

### Generating a Grenade

Roll on the Gun Rarity table on page 81 of the *Bunkers & Badasses* sourcebook, then roll 1d4 for a Manufacturer.

Depending on the level, you’ll then roll between `dice: 1d20` and `dice: 5d20` for Payloads. With multiple similar Payloads being cumulative.

| 13-18 | 3d8 | 3 |

^BnB-Scouts-Grenades-Payload
\*If a Grenade has an Elemental Cloud and/or Elemental Damage Payload, roll for Element **once** and use it for each of those parts.


You can also roll 1d20 to give them a Prefix from the **Grenade and Spell Prefixes** table.

Grenades can also be given Red Text, especially Legendary Grenades, or really just Grenades you want to give one, but probably Legendary Grenades. 

If you do, only roll 1d20 for a Payload no matter what level it is, as the Red Text effect *should* make up for the missing Payload effects.

## Spells

Spells also have four manufacturers that each focus on different ways to cast spells: 
- **Conjura** spells are “Simple Cast” and function like standard grenades, just point and cast. They gain bonus damage per damage die.
- **Arken** spells are “Channel Cast” and require more time before casting. Charging them up costs more spell slots, but often for much larger effects. They have a maximum number of slots you can invest in a single cast.
- **Wyrd Weaver** spells are “Repeating Cast” and can be cast multiple times at the cost of one spell slot, if you’re willing to generate a little mayhem. There’s a limit to the number of times they can Echo, though.
- **Miraculum** spells are “Self Cast” and their effects are often centered on the caster, but last longer. They all have a Throw Range of 0 and a duration of 2 or more Turns.

There are 10 types of spells available for players to cast, each with their own flair and magical *je ne says quoi*, (whatever that means,) to make your magical blasting as Badass as possible.

- **Arc Torrent** spells call down bolts of lightning on your enemies to smite them from above with Shock Damage.
- **Sigil** spells summon circles of protection around you, buffing allies and hindering foes in a wide area.
- **Eruption** spells function mostly like standard grenades, causing an explosion wherever you point that knocks back foes.
- **Fireball** spells need no introduction, they’re Fireballs. In the words of a great, and wiggly, Bardbarian: “*Just use Fireball*.”
- **Sunder** spells create fissures along the ground, damaging every enemy in their path, even if they’re hiding behind walls.
- **Talon** spells conjure spectral wyverns that fly around, harrying enemies. And, y’know, damaging them.
- **Hydra** spells summon *Hydra Familiars* that attack the nearest enemy each turn. Yes, they count as Familiars for skills.
- **Ice Spike** spells turn the battlefield into a frozen wasteland, summoning spikes and daggers of ice to freeze and murderize your enemies.
- **Barrage** spells pelt the hapless baddos with swarms of magic missiles, automatically seeking out the nearest enemies and pummeling them with arcane might.
- **Calamity** spells call down chunks of elemental hate straight from the heavens, dropping meteors teleported from low orbit directly onto some poor sap’s head. And torso. And friends. *Boom*.

^BnB-Scouts-Spells-Damage-By-Level

If you want, you can roll 1d20 on the Grenade and Spell Prefixes table to see if you get a prefix that improves the spell in some way.

![[Bunkers and Badasses/Items/Prefixes and Red Text/Wonderlands Prefixes#^c88705|Wonderlands Prefixes]]

Spells can be given Red Text if you want, in which case they don’t have to abide by any of this. Those can work however you want! Though maybe keep the Manufacturer effects, just to make life easier on you.
