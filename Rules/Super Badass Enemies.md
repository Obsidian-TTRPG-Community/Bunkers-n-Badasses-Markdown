Super Badass Enemies are an even greater threat than regular Badass Enemies as they possess increased speed, strength, and lethality. To spawn a Super Badass of an enemy type, multiply the Badass Rank (BR) by three when spawning enemies.

For instance, if you want to spawn a Super Badass Skeleton, the BR would be 9, which is three times the normal Skeleton BR of 3. 
- Similarly, dragons will also triple their BR, resulting in dragons of ***BR 63***. ðŸ˜¨

Super Badass Enemies also have the following compared to their normal, unbadass counterparts:
- Medium-sized enemies gain triple the Base Health, Armor, and Shields.
- Large-sized enemies gain quadrupled the Base health, Armor, and Shields.
- Gain Shields and Armor Equal to 1/2 SuperBadass Health if they did not have Shields and Armor before
- Super Badass Enemies are not idiots, and Actions ***and*** Mayhem Actions freely. ðŸ’€

> Want an extra challenge? Add Health, Shield, and Armor Regen of 1d10 (`dice: 1d10`) **per** player **per** turn. ðŸ˜±

Additionally, they get **two** modifiers from the sourcebook's Enemy Trait Table or any homebrewed Enemy Trait Table, rolled at random or chosen by the Bunkermaster, whomever is more *sadistic*.
