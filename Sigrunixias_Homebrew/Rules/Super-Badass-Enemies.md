# Super Badass Enemies

> **Homebrew**: This is a Homebrew Ruleset that adds SuperBadass Enemies.

Badass Enemies are dangerous foes, but Super Badasses are even deadlier; they are faster, stronger, and more murderous than regular Badass Enemies. When spawning Enemies, you can opt to spawn a Super Badass of the Enemy type by multiplying the Badass Rank by three.

> For example, a Super Badass Skeleton would have a Badass Rank of 9 instead of the normal Skeleton BR of 3.
> In the case of dragons, yes, they will also triple their BR and you will face dragons of BR 63.

Super Badass Enemies also have the following compared to their normal, unbadass counterparts:

- Medium-sized enemies gain triple the Base Health, Armor, and Shields.
- Large-sized enemies gain quadrupled the Base health, Armor, and Shields.
- Gain Shields and Armor Equal to 1/2 SuperBadass Health if they did not have Shields and Armor before
- They use Actions and Mayhem Actions freely.

> Want an extra challenge? Add Health, Shield, and Armor Regen of 1d10 (`dice: 1d10`) per player per turn.

Additionally, they get a two modifiers from the modifier table below, rolled at random or chosen by the BM.
