> [!skill] Kinetic Aspis
> **Details**:: Draw forth your Kinetic Aspis for 2 turns. While itâ€™s active, you ignore all damage from the front. Each hit ignored by your Aspis stores `dice: 1d4` damage in it, with each Crit ignored storing `dice: 2d4` damage, max of `dice: 4d4` stored damage. For the duration of Kinetic Aspis, you may use an action to Throw it at a target within 8 squares, and the Aspis is automatically Thrown at the end of its duration. Throwing Aspis deals the stored damage to whoever you hit.
> **Uses**::  MST Mod per Day + 1/Encounter
