## PhaseShout

*Requires*: [The Siren of Law](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren%20of%20Law/Siren%20of%20Law.md)

The Siren of Law unleashes a powerful sonic shout that shatters objects and ripples through reality. They can move up to **4** squares, dealing `dice: 1d10`(**1d10**) shock damage and `dice: 1d10`(**1d10**) physical damage to each target in or adjacent to any square moved past.

PhaseShout has a `dice: 1d12`(**1d12**) potential to stun targets for one round if it lands on a **1-5**.

- At level 30, this ability becomes [PhaseScream](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren%20of%20Law/PhaseScream.md)
