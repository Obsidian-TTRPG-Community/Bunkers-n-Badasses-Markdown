## PhaseTalk

*Requires*: [The Siren of Law](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren%20of%20Law/Siren%20of%20Law.md)

The Siren of Law unleashes a sonic shout that echoes through objects and briefly disrupts reality. They can move up to **3** squares, dealing `dice: 1d8`(**1d8**) shock damage and `dice: 1d8`(**1d8**) physical damage to each target in or adjacent to any square moved past.

Phasetalk has a `dice: 1d8`(**1d8**) potential to stun targets for one round if it lands on a **1-4**.

- At level 16, this ability becomes [PhaseShout](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren%20of%20Law/PhaseShout.md)
