## My Universe, My Rules

*Requires*: [The Siren of Law](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren%20of%20Law/Siren%20of%20Law.md)

The Siren of Law has a natural talent for persuasion and manipulation, and can use their charisma and powers of suggestion to influence the behavior of others, convincing them to follow the rules and laws that they deem necessary for maintaining order.

This ability grants them a **+10 bonus to all Talk Checks** related to convincing others to follow laws and rules.

***Limitation(s)***: The laws and rules that the Siren of Law wishes to enforce must already be known and recognized by the community or society they are trying to govern. They cannot impose new laws or rules without formal notice of changes.
