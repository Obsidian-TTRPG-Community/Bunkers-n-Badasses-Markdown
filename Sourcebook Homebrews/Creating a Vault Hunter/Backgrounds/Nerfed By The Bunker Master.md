> [!skill] Nerfed by the Bunker Master
> **Archetype**:: Protagonist
> **Benefit**:: +1 DMG, +1 MST, +1 ACC, +1 Max HP, +1 Stat of Choice
> **Details**:: Oh mortal, you have been born in a wondrous way! Like a hero of old, you have emerged fully formed from the mind of a deity, gifted with extraordinary abilities beyond the reach of mere mortals. But alas, such power comes at a cost, for you are too skilled for the world that awaits you. The divine hand that has crafted you has deemed it necessary to impose a penalty upon you, and so you shall be not as dextrous as your divine parentage. Worry not, for even with this limitation, you shall remain a force of fate. Go forth and let your legend be written!
