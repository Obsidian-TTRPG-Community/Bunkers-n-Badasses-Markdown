Be they a mechanical former drone or an androgynous Assassin, Vault Hunters come in all shapes and sizes. Each Class has a brief description of the typical appearance/clothing choice of that Class, but a Vault Hunter’s particular expression of visual badassitude is ultimately up to the player. Players may choose any appearance they wish, including Enemy types (be a goblin Mechromancer or even an orc Commando). If a Vault Hunter's tragic and epic backstory needs to have newly established bonuses or penalties, discuss with the BM.

Every Vault Hunter needs an epic name that truly encapsulates them. This name will be used by the BM and other party members so choose wisely, or ridiculously.

The fun of an RPG is to really get into the role playing aspect. It is an opportunity to live out strange and wonderful fantasies of adventure and heroism. As you embark on your adventures with your newly created Vault Hunter remember to immerse yourself, to let go and stretch your imagination. Become Gearstaff the Mechromancer or Shirtless Clyde the Psycho or whatever amazing and unique Vault Hunter you have created.

Congratulations, Vault Hunter -- you’ve done it! Your character is now ready to take into the harsh borderlands of Pan’Dorah!

Don’t die.
