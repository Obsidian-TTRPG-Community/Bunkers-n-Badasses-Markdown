Archetypes are an important part of the Bunkers and Badasses game, as they provide players with a set of pre-defined roles to take on. The Deadeye is a master marksman, capable of hitting enemies from far away. The Elementalist uses powerful elemental forces to unleash devastating attacks. The Enforcer is a tough warrior who can take on multiple opponents at once. The Fatemaker is a master strategist, devising strategies and tactics to give his team an advantage in battle. Finally, the Guardian is a stalwart defender, protecting their allies from harm. Each Archetype has its own unique set of abilities and play styles, allowing players to shape their character and create interesting stories in the game world.
