Elementalists focus on use of their Action Skill and -- surprise -- Elemental Damage. As all sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and Action Skills tend to involve advanced technology or literal magic (or, in one case, just holding two guns at the same time), the Elementalist is the Archetype you’ll wanna pick if you tend to play mages in other fantasy tabletop games.
