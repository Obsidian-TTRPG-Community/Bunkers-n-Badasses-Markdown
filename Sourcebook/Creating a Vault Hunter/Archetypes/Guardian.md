## Guardian

Guardians protect their friends. Not in a cleric-y, never-get-to-do- anything-cool kind of way, but in an “if my friends are nearby I get to shoot my gun again” kinda way.

Look, I’m not gonna tell you what to do with your life, but if your party is big enough, you might want a Guardian. Once they heal you from the brink of death, you’ll be thankful you have them.
