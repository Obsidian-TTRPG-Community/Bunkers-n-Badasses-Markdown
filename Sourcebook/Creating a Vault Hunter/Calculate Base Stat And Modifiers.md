To calculate **Base Stats**, combine Archetype Stats + Class Stats + Background Stats. 

Take an additional **3 points** and add them to any desired stat; either all in 1 or spread amongst a few. 

Write in the total Base Stat in the corresponding stat box on the Character Sheet.

To calculate **Modifiers** (Mod), simply divide each Base Stat in half, rounding down when the Base Stat is an odd number. 

Write each modifier in the smaller box.

| Accuracy | Damage | Speed  | Mastery |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 4 [+2]   | 2 [+1] | 3 [+1] | 4 [+2]  |
