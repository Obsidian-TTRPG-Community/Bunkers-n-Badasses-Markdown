A **Check** is a simple test to determine whether or not a Vault Hunter’s ability or knowledge can help them overcome a challenge or obstacle. A Check is typically performed by rolling a d20 against a difficulty set by the BM. The BM will ask for a Check whenever a player attempts to perform a non-trivial Action.

> **INSIGHT (ACC MOD)**
> Want to prove you know stuff about…stuff? That you’ve been around the Pan’Dorah’n block and have the memory to prove it? All the things you know about things are just an Insight Check away.
>
> **INTERACT (ACC MOD)**
> There are levers that need pulling, gates to be opened, and doors kicked in! Interact is all of these and anything else that needs to be handled, Thrown, or flail-ed about.
>
> **SEARCH (MST MOD)**
> Unsure if you’re walking into a trap? Suspect there might be some extra Loot hidden in a room? Why not perform a Search Check?
>
> **SNEAK (MST MOD)**
> When you want to do a thing and not get caught, like pick a lock, steal from a sleeping guard, or creep up on an Enemy, Sneak Checks are the way to go.
>
> **TALK (SPD MOD)**
> Going in guns blazin’ isn’t always the answer. Sometimes you need to mount a charm offensive. There can be value in Talking your way in or out of a situation.
>
> **TRAVERSE (SPD MOD)**
> Jump! Climb! Roll! Flip! Traverse Checks!

Place the corresponding Base Stat Modifiers in the first column of the "Checks" section on the Character Sheet. If a player has any additional Modifiers from Backgrounds, Traits, or Skills, place them in the Misc Mod section in the second column. Add (or subtract) the values to determine Check Modifiers for each type of Check.
