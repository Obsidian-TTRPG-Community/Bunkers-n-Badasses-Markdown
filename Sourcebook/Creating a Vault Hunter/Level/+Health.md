When Attacked, Enemies tend to Attack back. **Health** is a measurement of how close the player is to purchasing a one way ticket to the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns. A Vault Hunter’s Health is based on Level.

To calculate max Health at Level 1, add 10 to the highest value on the Melee Die. (ex. Assassin has a 1d6 Melee Die, so 6+10=16 max Health).

Health Regen occurs when a player takes no Damage over the course of a turn. Health regenerates equal to Regen value, up to max Health. Level 1 Vault Hunters don’t start with points in Health Regen, but can add Regen points through good choices.
