Bunkers & Badasses is all about being a badass. Badass Rank is a badge of honor worn proudly like a necklace of skag ears.

At Level 1, a Vault Hunter begins with 1 Badass Rank and 0 Badass Tokens. Badass Rank is not the same as Vault Hunter Level. Badass Rank should Level Up about half as often as Character Level.

More on Badass Ranks and Tokens on page 62.
