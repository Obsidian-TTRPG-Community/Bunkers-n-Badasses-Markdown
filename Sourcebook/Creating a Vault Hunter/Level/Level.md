Every Vault Hunter has a unique and varied past full of experiences that eventually lead them to a life of hunting vaults. But once a vault hunting journey begins, all Vault Hunters begin at Level 1. It is by adventuring and escapading throughout Pan’Dorah that a Vault Hunter’s Level increases with the accumulation of Experience Points, or XP. For the full rules of Leveling Up, see the Leveling Up section.
