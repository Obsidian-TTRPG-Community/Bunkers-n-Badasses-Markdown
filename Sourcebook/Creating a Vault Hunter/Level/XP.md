The sweet nectar of progress, Experience Points (XP), track the Vault Huntersâ€™ journey. Overcoming challenges and puzzles allows the party to gain shared XP as a group.

- At Level 1, write 100 on the "XP Bar" line on the Character Sheet.
- For every 100 XP earned, a new segment is filled in.
- Once 10 segments are filled in, a new Level is achieved.

See [[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Playing The Game/Leveling Up/Leveling Up|Leveling Up]] for leveling up rewards.
