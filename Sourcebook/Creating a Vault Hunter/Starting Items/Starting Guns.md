Guns! Guns! Guns! Well, a crappy basic gun, but it’s a start! Have each player choose 1 of the 2 from their Favored Gun types (listed on the Class pages). Using the Starter Gun Chart, have them fill out a blank Gun Card with the corresponding stats. Then, have them choose a Guild for their crappy starting gun, and refer to the Guild Bonus Chart for what bonuses to write down on the Gun Card.

On their starting Gun Card, make sure they put a reminder on there that it is their Favored Gun type, so they can get that sweet bonus to their Accuracy and Damage Rolls!

More information on guns and Guild bonuses start in .
