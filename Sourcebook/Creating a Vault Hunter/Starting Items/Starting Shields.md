Every Vault Hunter begins their adventure with a Standard High Intensity Defense Shield (SHIDS). It has a capacity of 20 and a Recharge Rate of 5. Shields take first Damage, and once they are depleted, Health is impacted. At the end of a turn, if the player has not taken any Damage, Shields Recharge equal to the Recharge Rate of the equipped Shield, up to the value of the max Shields. If any Damage occurred during the turn, their Shield does not Recharge. Shields fully Recharge at the end of every encounter.
