>[!echostone-desc]- Now retrieving ECHOstone Description of……… **Assassin**
> **Class Description**
>Silent and mercenary, the Assassin’s goals are shrouded in mystery. Do they fight for the thrill of the kill? Or do they care only about their payday? Enigmatic and deadly -- but in a cool, sexy way, not a tryhard edgelord way -- the Assassin strikes swiftly and stealthily, whether by stabbing their Enemies in the back or sniping them from afar.
>
>The Assassin prefers a stealthy approach to combat, favoring their natural talent for lurksmanship.
> 
>**Appearance**
>To stay light and quick, an Assassin usually wears fitted clothing or Armor. Assassins also prefer to wear masks, which typically hide their face, gender, and motives. All the better to brood mysteriously.

## Class Fantasy

Silent and lethal, the Assassin is a master of deception and combat. Enshrouded in mystery, they blend into the shadows and strike with deadly precision. Are they driven by honour or do they only crave the thrill of the hunt? It is hard to tell, for the Assassin's motives remain veiled.

### Competencies

The Assassin is a lethal opponent in combat, utilising their natural talent for stealth to gain the element of surprise. They are experts in a variety of weapons, including knives, laser blades, and energy guns. Their arsenal allows them to approach their targets in any situation, whether from the shadows or across a vast expanse of space.

In addition to their deadly proficiency in combat, the Assassin possesses impressive skills in deception and disguise. They are able to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, and their quick reflexes and agility allow them to evade enemy attacks.

### Common Raiment's

The Assassin's attire is sleek and lightweight, designed for ease of movement and agility. They often don a helmet or mask, which not only provides protection, but also conceals their identity and adds to their mystique.
