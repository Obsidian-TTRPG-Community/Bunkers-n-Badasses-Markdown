> [!skill] Decepti0n
> **Details**:: The Assassin becomes Cloaked for **2** turns, sending out an illusionary decoy that mimics their Attacks and movements for the duration of Decepti0n (mimicked Attacks do not deal Damage or have any effect). Performing any Attack while Decepti0n is active will break the cloak and illusion, but will upgrade all Hits to Crits for that Attack.
