## Class Fantasy

The Berserker is a Vault Hunter who loves nothing more than punching things into submission. With their incredible strength and unbridled aggression, they are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. They also possess impressive shooting skills, although they prefer to get up close and personal whenever possible.

### Competencies

The Berserker is a melee-focused class, utilizing their immense strength and close-combat skills to overpower their enemies. They are able to withstand a great deal of damage thanks to their toughened bodies, and can regenerate health quickly when they enter a rage.

In addition to their formidable melee abilities, the Berserker is also skilled in the use of firearms. They are proficient with a variety of weapons, but they have a particular fondness for rocket launchers and combat rifles.

### Common Raiments

The Berserker is a towering figure, with bulging muscles and an intimidating presence. They often wear heavy armor or protective gear, which not only provides protection, but also enhances their already impressive strength.
