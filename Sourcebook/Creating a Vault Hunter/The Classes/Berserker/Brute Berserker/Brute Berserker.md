The world was a harsh and unforgiving place, a wasteland where only the strong survived. The Brute had grown up in this world, learning to fight and scavenge and kill from a young age. But even by the brutal standards of their world, they were different - bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than most.

They had always been a bit of a loner, preferring the company of their fists to that of other people. But as they grew older, they started to attract attention - both admiration and fear - from others in the wasteland. Some called them a brute, others a psycho, and most, a monster. Few saw them as a savior, a protector, a force of nature against the cosmic horrors.

The Brute didn't care about labels. They only cared about survival, and about the rush of combat. They would go on raiding runs with other wastelanders, taking on gangs of marauders or scavenging for valuable supplies. In battle, they were the decider of fates, a whirlwind of fists and bullets and screams.

But the changes in their body and mind couldn't be ignored. They felt a constant itch under their skin, a need to fight and destroy. They saw themselves in the mirror and barely recognized the hulking, scarred flesh that stared back at them. When their body no longer matched the mental picture they had of themselves, they knew that they had become something different - something beyond that of a normal human.

And in this world, being different was a dangerous thing. The Brute attracted enemies as easily as they did followers. But they didn't care. They would fight and kill and die for what they believed in - their own survival, and the survival of those they deemed worthy of protection. They were a living weapon, a symbol of both hope and terror in a world that had long since lost both.
