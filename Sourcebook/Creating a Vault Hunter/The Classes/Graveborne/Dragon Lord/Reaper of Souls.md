> [!skill] Reaper of Souls
> [**Details**:: The Dragon Lord becomes the Reaper of Souls. While in this form, roll an extra 2d12 when rolling for Damage. The higher value is added to the attack as Damage, while the lower value is taken by Dragon Lord as Health Loss. When Dragon Lord would drop below 1 Health, remain at 1 Health and exit Reaper of Souls instead.]
