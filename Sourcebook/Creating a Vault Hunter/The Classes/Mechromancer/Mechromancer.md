### CLASS INFORMATION

A perfect melding of person and machine, the Mechromancer is a technical genius whose robot buddy distracts and attracts while they blast away with reckless abandon.

### APPEARANCE

Mechromancers tinker with EVERYTHING, including their personal appearance. It’s not uncommon to meet a Mechromancer who is more machine than flesh, with prosthetic limbs and rusty, cybernetic enhancements everywhere. But they’re still cute, and they’ve still got a fashion sense that leans toward the punky and rebellious.
