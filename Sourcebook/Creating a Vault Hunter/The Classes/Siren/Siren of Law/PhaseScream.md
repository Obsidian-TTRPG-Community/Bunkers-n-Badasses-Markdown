## PhaseScream

*Requires*: [The Siren of Law](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren/Siren%20of%20Law/Siren%20of%20Law.md)

The Siren of Law unleashes a powerful sonic scream that shatters objects and forms a vortex in reality. They can move up to **5** squares and release a PhaseScream, dealing `dice: 1d10` (**1d10**) shock damage and `dice: 1d10` (**1d10**) physical damage to each target in or adjacent to any square moved past.

PhaseScream has a `dice: 1d20`(**1d20**) potential to stun targets for one round if it lands on a **1-8**.

PhaseScream can be used ***twice*** per MST mod.
