*Requires*: [The Siren of Time](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/The%20Classes/Siren/Siren%20of%20Time/Siren%20of%20Time.md)

The Siren of Time can access knowledge and information from different points in time by consulting with their past or future selves, or accessing a time-lost database or library.
