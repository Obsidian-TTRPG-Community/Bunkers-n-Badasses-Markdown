### Class Information

Sirens can be found throughout the universe, although it is believed that only six can exist at once. No one knows how a Siren is created or chosen, and they have immeasurable powers.

>[!Excerpt] On Sirensâ€¦
> Sirens are mysterious and enigmatic beings, shrouded in mystery and legend. They are said to have the ability to control the tides of time and space, and to have the power to manipulate the thoughts and emotions of those around them. Many believe that they are ancient deities, worshipped by cultures throughout the universe. Despite their immense powers, Sirens are rare and elusive, with only a handful known to exist at any given time. It is said that they are chosen by the universe itself, and that their powers are granted to them for a higher purpose.

### Appearance

Sirens can be easily identified by their luminous tattoos that radiate when their powers are activated.

>[!excerpt] On Siren Tattoos
> These tattoos can cover their entire body and are said in myth to hold the secrets of the universe. The patterns and symbols on their skin are constantly changing and shifting, reflecting the Siren's mood and power.
