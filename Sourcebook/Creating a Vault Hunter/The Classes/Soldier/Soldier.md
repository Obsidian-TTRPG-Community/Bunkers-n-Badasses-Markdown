APPEARANCE

A Soldier’s fatigues vary depending on their job and rank. Medics would have medpacks strapped to their belts and lighter armor to get around a battlefield, whereas Frontline soldiers would be wearing heavy armor and darker camo to blend in at night.

They dress like Roland. It's Roland.
