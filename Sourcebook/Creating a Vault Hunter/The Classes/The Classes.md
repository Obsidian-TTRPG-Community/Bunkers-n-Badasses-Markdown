I’ve asked it before, but I'll ask it again: what kind of badass do you wanna be?

Are you a Mechromancer, using your robotic buddy to tear your Enemies apart?

Or are you a Siren who prefers to use her magic to scramble the brains and/or internal organs of the bad guys?

If you’re a first-time player, you’re gonna want to give the following Class descriptions a good read. But also, don’t be TOO worried—if you end up not liking the Class you pick, you can always change it later on. It doesn’t, like, make narrative sense that a Gunzerker could suddenly become a Siren, but:

- Who
- Cares

I mean, if you REALLY want to, you can say there was a malfunction in a BREW-U Cauldron that caused the particular Vault Hunter to respawn with an entirely new set of Skills. Or maybe the player character just up and decided they didn’t like magic anymore and wanted to focus on their Turret Skills. Either way, don’t feel like you shouldn’t let your players switch up their Classes just for the sake of the story.
