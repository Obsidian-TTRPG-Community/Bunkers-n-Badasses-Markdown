| 1            | **Maniacal**: Anytime you find something humorous, you begin a maniacal laughter that lasts too long. You find all death and destruction humorous. |
| 2            | **Grump**: You are a grump. If any other player can elicit a genuine laugh from you, they get +1 to their next roll.                               |
