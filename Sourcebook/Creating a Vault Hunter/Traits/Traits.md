Each Vault Hunter gets two **Traits**, one chosen and one rolled, using two d10s (one with tens values). Each player gets one re-roll. Write the two Traits on the back of the Character Sheet in the section marked “Traits”; feel free to embellish. Include the Checks bonus that the Trait provides.

Possibly mark that Check with an asterisk as a reminder of the special bonus.
