There are many types of badasses in the world. Shooty badasses. Flamey badasses. Explodey badasses.

Choosing an **Archetype** and **Class** is your opportunity to decide which type of badass you’d like to be.

The four Archetypes are **[[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating a Vault Hunter/Archetypes/Deadeye|Deadeye]]**, **[[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating a Vault Hunter/Archetypes/Elementalist|Elementalist]]**, **[[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating a Vault Hunter/Archetypes/Enforcer|Enforcer]]**, and **[[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating a Vault Hunter/Archetypes/Guardian|Guardian]]**. 
- Enforcers do a lot of Damage
- Elementalists focus on their Action Skill
- Deadeyes don’t miss
- Guardians never stop moving

Archetypes are found starting in the ***[Archetypes](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/Archetypes/Archetypes.md)*** section. While choosing an Archetype, also read through the various **Archetype Feats** and select one for your chosen Archetype. Some Feats may have requirements that must be met before that Feat can be selected. Write the selected Archetype on the Character Sheet in the "Archetype" section, and write the value of each stat in the corresponding stat box. Then, write the Archetype Feat in the "Skills and Feats" section (at Level 5 there will be an opportunity to learn a second Archetype).
