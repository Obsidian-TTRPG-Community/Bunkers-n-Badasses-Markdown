What’s your hero fantasy? Maybe you’re a dual-wielding madman, cackling with delight as your casings hit the ground. Or maybe you’re a precise, mysterious killer for hire. Regardless of your choice, your Class is how you embody your particular power fantasy.

Bunkers & Badasses features nine Classes, and each has a Skill Tree that is unique to their Class. Want to use fists to forcibly  remove the “Un” from “Undead”? The Berserker could be right for you. Want a mech<span style="color:hotpink">*</span> who can punch and mow down spiderants? Mechromancer has you covered. Whatever your taste in destruction, there is a Class where you will thrive. <span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">* like a normal robot, but  * * * * fantasy * * * *</span>

The nine base Classes are: **Assassin**, **Berserker**, **Commando**, **Gunzerker**, **Hunter**, **Mechromancer**, **Psycho**, **Siren**, and **Soldier**.

More info on Classes starts in ***[Creating A Vault Hunter: The Classes](The-Classes)***.

After selecting one, write the Class name on the Character Sheet.
