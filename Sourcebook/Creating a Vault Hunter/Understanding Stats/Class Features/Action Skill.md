An **Action Skill** is a special ability that a Vault Hunter can perform once per encounter and an additional number of times per Pan’Dorah day based on their Mastery Modifier (MST Mod).

For example, a player with a 3 MST Mod can use their Action Skill once in every encounter and then use it again up to 3 times per day. They can even use all 3 extra Action Skills in the same encounter if they are crazy like that.

Most Action Skills allow a player to perform special Attacks or maneuvers that give a powerful edge during an encounter (or when showing off). Write the name and description of the Action Skill on your Character Sheet in the section provided.

Additional notes for your Action Skill can be placed into the “Familiar/Action Skill Notes” section, including total Damage in the box labeled “Damage” to the right of the section.
