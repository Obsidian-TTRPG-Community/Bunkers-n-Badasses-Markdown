There are a range of **Backgrounds** to choose from for each Class, listed on the Class pages. Each Background gives a glimpse at what life was like before becoming a Vault Hunter, and grants some bonuses and penalties based on past adventures. Once a Background is selected, it can be written in the "Backgrounds" section on the back of the Character Sheet. Note whether the Background modifies any stats.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
link(file.path, title) as Background,
class as Class
From #BnB/Backgrounds
SORT class Asc
```
