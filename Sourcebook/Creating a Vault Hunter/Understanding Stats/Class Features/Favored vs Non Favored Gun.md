Each Class has one gun they prefer over all others. The kind they sleep next to (or with [not like that]) every night. We call this particular type of gun the Vault Hunter’s **Favored Gun**.

When making a Ranged Attack with a Favored Gun, Vault Hunters add their ACC and DMG Mods to their respective rolls (Accuracy Roll and Damage Roll). Players can also gain additional Favored Gun types from Level Up rewards found in their Archetype Trees.

Each Class has a choice of 2 Favored Guns at the start but more options become available through Leveling Up. There is a spot on the Character Sheet to fill in Favored Gun type. Non-Favored Guns are fun too, and should not be discounted. They just don’t have the stat bonuses.

Sometimes you want to shoot a Rocket Launcher, but that doesn’t mean you want to make it your BFF.
