When feeling the desire to punch something, either (A) seek therapy, or (B) bring out the **Melee Die**.

Melee Attacks in Bunkers & Badasses usually Hit simply due to proximity, but there is a chance to miss or possibly deal even more Damage. Each Class has a Melee Die listed in their Class Features.

When creating a Vault Hunter, write down the die type in the "Melee Die" box provided on the Character Sheet.
