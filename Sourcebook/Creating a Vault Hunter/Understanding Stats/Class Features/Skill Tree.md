Okay, so -- this part is gonna look complicated, but itâ€™s not as scary as it seems.

Each Class has its own specific **Skill Tree**. As play progresses, the player will be able to unlock more and more cool stuff in their Skill Tree. Each Skill Tree has a few sections: Class Name, Skill Tree Name, Skill Tiers, and Skills. At Level 1, the first Skill Point (SP) can only be placed in a tier 1 Skill. 3 Skill Points are needed in a tier to unlock the next tier. The Skill Level (SL) of a Skill is based on how many Skill Points have been placed into a certain Skill.
