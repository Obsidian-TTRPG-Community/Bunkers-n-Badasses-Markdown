Choosing how to allocate the four main stat points shapes the character and play style of each unique Vault Hunter. Adding points to stats will have direct and indirect effects on a range of gameplay elements including encounters, Checks, and Skill Tree efficacy.

>[!skill] Stats
> **ACCURACY (ACC)**
> Accuracy refers to your ability to Hit a specific target when aiming. The Accuracy stat is applied several different ways throughout play. The most obvious way is in combat. More Accuracy, more Hits. That includes anything you might Throw, like grenades, Barrels, or your shoe. Accuracy stats also influence both Insight and Interact Checks.
>
> **DAMAGE (DMG)**
> Damage is an easy stat to understand as it only applies to combat and Throw distance. How much hurt can you rain down on your Enemies and how far can you hurl that hurt.
>
> **SPEED (SPD)**
> Speed represents both how fast you can move, which matters a great deal when dodging Enemy Attacks, and how far. By default, you can move 3 squares per turn. Any addition to the Speed stat increases Movement Range. Speed is also applied when rolling Initiative and for Traverse and Talk Checks.
>
> **MASTERY (MST)**
> Mastery is the focus and proficiency you bring to certain Skills. Each Vault Hunter has a specific Action Skill that can be used once per encounter by default. Increasing Mastery allows for more frequent Action Skill opportunities. It also improves Sneak and Search Checks and influences Health gains.
