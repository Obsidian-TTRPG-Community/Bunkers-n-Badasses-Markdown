## Melee Attack

<span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">For when you want to get in reaaaal close.</span>

1. **Choose a Target**: The player chooses a target in an adjacent square. 
2. **Roll**: Roll 1d20 to resolve the Accuracy of the Melee Attack.
	1: FAIL  
	2-15: Normal Damage
	16-19: +1 Damage Die 
	20: Double Damage

If the roll is a natural 20 (before Mods) they will add a Crit to their Damage Roll.

1. **Damage**: The player gathers and rolls the Damage dice shown in the Melee box on their Character Sheet (plus any extra dice or Crits from their Accuracy Roll). They then apply Damage equal to the total of the dice rolled plus their DMG Mod.
