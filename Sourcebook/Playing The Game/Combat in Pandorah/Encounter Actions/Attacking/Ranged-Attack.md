## Ranged Attack

<span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">Attacking is how to make things that are alive, less so.</span>

1. **Choose a Target**: The player chooses a target that is within the Range their current gun can shoot (gun Ranges are listed on the Gun Card). A Vault Hunter canâ€™t choose a target that is out of their Range.

2. **Accuracy Roll**: The player rolls 1d20, (adding their ACC Mod if it is a Favored Gun type) and any other bonuses. With that number total, they consult the Accuracy box on the Gun Card to see how many Hits and Crits  are scored.
	a. If a player rolls a natural 1 (before Mods) on their Accuracy Roll, they fail the Attack. If the Attack fails, the player spends their Action Reloading and 1 Mayhem Point is generated. The rest of their turn is unaffected by the Reload.
	b. If a player rolls a natural 20 (before Mods) on their Accuracy Roll, they add an extra Crit to their Damage Roll in addition to their normal Accuracy results.

 3. **Roll and Apply Damage**: For each Hit, they will roll the die depicted in the Damage Box of their gun. For each Crit, they will roll `dice: 1d12`. The player totals the sum of all dice rolled (as well as their DMG Mod if using a Favored Gun type) and any other bonuses. If the gun has an Element type, all Damage dealt will be that Elemental type. The player should announce Element type(s) when declaring the total Damage to the BM, who will then apply any additional effects if necessary.

For example, Skye makes a Ranged Attack with her Crappy Rifle. She rolls a 19 on 1d20 for her Accuracy Roll. She subtracts -3 to the result due to the gun effects of the Crappy Rifle. She then adds her ACC Mod (+2) since she is using a Favored Gun type, scoring a total of 18. She consults the Accuracy Chart on the Gun Card to see she successfully Hits 3 times and Crits 1 time. The Crappy Rifle uses a d6 for its Damage Die, so she rolls a total of 3d6 and 1d12. She adds up the dice results to get 15. She adds her DMG Mod (+1) because she is using a Favored Gun type, and gets a total of 16 Damage for her Attack.
