## Drink A Potion

A Vault Hunter may freely drink any potion they have in their inventory at any time during their turn. This immediately grants them the benefit of the potion before performing other Actions. Players can hold 3 potions in their inventory. 
- If they acquire a new potion but their bag is full, they can consume a potion and immediately pick up the new potion or ***[Throw it](Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/2%20Playing%20The%20Game/Combat%20in%20Pandorah/Encounter%20Actions/Throw-And-Hand-Off-Items.md)*** to an ally. 

The types of potions a player may find are limited only by the imagination of the BM, but the most common ones are basic Health and Shield Potions. For more potion options see.
