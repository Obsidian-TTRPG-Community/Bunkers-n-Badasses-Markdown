## Hold Actions

A player may also Hold Actions instead of taking normal Actions on their turn. When a player Holds Actions, they are waiting for something to happen before they Act. 
- This could be waiting until another party member takes their turn to set up a Badass Teamwork Move.
- Or until an Enemy moves close to that cliff so they can shove them off it. 

If a player is Holding Actions until a specific event, and that event never occurs, they take their turn last during the After Enemies step.
