## Movement

Agility on the battlefield is crucial in combat. Players will always get the chance to move during their turn.

Movement is equal to 3 squares + SPD bonus. Moves may be split up with other Actions (ex. a player can move 1 square, Attack an Enemy, and then move additional squares). Players canâ€™t move through Enemy spaces but with a polite excuse me, or a cordial grunt, they can pass through ally spaces.

When performing Actions like climb, slide, or jump, that may be extraordinary, a ***[Traverse Check](../../../Interacting-With-Pandorah/Bnb-Checks/Traverse%20Check.md)*** may be necessary to proceed.

If a player enters a square with Loot Piles, Movement is paused and the BM will roll up the Loot, which is then picked up automatically. For rolling Loot Generation, see.
