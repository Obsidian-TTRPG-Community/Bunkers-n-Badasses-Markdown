## Perform Checks

Any of the 6 Checks could potentially come up in combat. 

- A player may need to Traverse over obstacles or get Insight into the motivations of an Enemy. 
- They may need to Interact with a Corrosive Barrel or Search for a more creative weapon. 
- They could attempt to Sneak up on a target or Talk a Boss out of killing them (no chance that works). 

Like non-combat Checks, the BM will adjudicate the outcome of combat Checks. 

1 Mayhem Point is generated for attempting the Check, and an additional 1 Point is gained if the player fails the Check.
