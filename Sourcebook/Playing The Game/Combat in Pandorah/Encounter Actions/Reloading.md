## Reloading

For the most part, you won't need to worry about Reloading. UNLESS you roll a 1 on a Ranged Attack or if you want to spend your Action Reloading to trigger an effect on a Skill or Feat. In either scenario, any Skill or Guild conditions will then go into effect and 1 Mayhem Point is gained. The player can still do other non-Attack turn Actions.
