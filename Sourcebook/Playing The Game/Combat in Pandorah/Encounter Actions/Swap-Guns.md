## Swap Guns

A Vault Hunter always needs the right tool for the job. Most of the time that tool is a better gun. Players can have a total of 3 active guns and unlimited inactive guns. Inactive guns can't be accessed during combat. Players can, however, switch between their active
guns in battle at a cost of 1 Mayhem Point.
