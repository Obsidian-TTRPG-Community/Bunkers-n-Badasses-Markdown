## Throw and Hand Off Items

When a player wishes to Throw or Hand Off an item, whether that’s a gun into another Vault Hunter's waiting hands, or a piece of debris into an orc’s not-so-waiting mouth hole, the following occurs:

If the distance of a Throw is within a number of squares equal to or less than the player's DMG Mod, the Throw always succeeds. For a further Throw, the player must pass an Accuracy Roll of 12 or higher by rolling a d20 and adding their ACC Mod (the BM can alter the difficulty number based on the situation). 
- If the player passes, the Throw succeeds. 
- If they fail, the BM determines where the item lands and what happens next.

If a player is adjacent to the Target, they will Hand Off the Item. 
- If a player is 1 or more Squares away from their Target, they will attempt to Throw the Item using the Throw rules.

Throws do not generate Mayhem, but Handing Off an item generates 1 Mayhem Point.
