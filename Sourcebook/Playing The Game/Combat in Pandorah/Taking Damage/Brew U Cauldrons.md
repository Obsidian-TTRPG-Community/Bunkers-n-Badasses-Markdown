## Brew-U Cauldrons

The BREW-U Cauldron is another magical invention -- initially prototyped by the Hyperius Guild, but later adapted into mass- market existence by anyone with a few spare unicorn hearts and a can-do attitude -- that allows any who register with it to be reborn shortly after their death. The massive vat of grog, magic, and unicorn blood is capable of reviving anyone who has sipped from it… with a catch.

More often than not, the BREW-U revivification process does not go smoothly. Those who are revived come back with some form of Trauma, which usually only lasts until the end of the day… assuming the death that preceded the revivification was not particularly gruesome. Respawning can be very costly as well, resulting in a loss of 10% of the player's total gold (the BREW-U Cauldrons are expensive to maintain).

If said death WAS particularly gruesome, the Trauma suffered by the revived Vault Hunter is Permanent.

Knowing that the BREW-U Cauldrons exist, players may be tempted to behave recklessly and treat death as if it does not matter.

So long as this causes them to do things that are badass or stupid or hilarious, this isn't such a big deal. The almighty BM can always find a reason to temporarily shut down the BREW-U, so player beware!

If a player respawns at a BREW-U during an encounter, the BM will determine how many turns before they return to the combat area.
