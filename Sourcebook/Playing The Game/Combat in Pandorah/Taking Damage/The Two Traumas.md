## The Two Traumas

The two types of Traumas are Temporary or Permanent. 
- Temporary Traumas either have immediate effects or last only until the end of the current day. 
- Whereas, Permanent Traumas can have a more long-lasting impact, even potentially changing how a Vault Hunter plays the game going forward. 

See the Trauma Tables on.
