## Badass Assist

Any party member can assist a player in their Badass Move by sacrificing their turn and joining the shenanigans. Based on the declared Badass Move of the first player, the assisting player describes what additional moves they are adding into the mix to help their teammate. Again, it is up to the BM to decide if the assist adds any Badassitude to the situation. Along with the initiating player, all assisting players roll a Badass Die and the values are totaled.
