## Badass Die

The Badass Die is similar to a standard d20, but with higher highs and lower lows. A standard d20 has numbers 1-20 each represented once. The Badass d20 has three 1s and three 20s, with the other numbers filling in their normal spots.

Roll a standard d20 with the following changes:
- On a roll of a 1, 2, or 3. The roll equals 1.
- On a roll of a 18, 19, or 20. The roll equals 21.
