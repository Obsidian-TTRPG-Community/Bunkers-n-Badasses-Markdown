## Badass Move: Description

The player begins a Badass Move by describing, in detail, what they want to do on their turn, including all the Actions required to make the Badass Move happen (Movements, Attacks, perform Checks, etc.) while being as descriptive as possible. If the Vault Hunter has any catchphrases or one liners, they should absolutely feel free to pepper those in now, too. The BM is the final determination on whether the turn described is Badass enough to qualify as a Badass Move. If they deem it worthy they will then assign a difficulty level to the move.
