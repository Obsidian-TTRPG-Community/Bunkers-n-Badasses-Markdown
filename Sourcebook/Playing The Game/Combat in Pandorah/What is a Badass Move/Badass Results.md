## Badass Results

If the player succeeds at rolling equal to or higher than the Badass difficulty, the player walks through the actions laid out in their description and performs them using their Badass Stats. Any actions from Assists are also resolved using the Badass Stats (but all other actions for the round do not get the benefit of Badass Stats for Assisting players).

For example, after a successful Badass Move, if the Enemy is still alive and retaliates, the player who successfully performed the Badass Move will get to dodge the attack using their SPEED stat instead of their SPD Modifier, but any players who assisted the Badass Move would not get that benefit.

If the player fails by rolling less than the Badass difficulty, the BM relays in horrific detail the shameful outcome, and the player continues to use the teeny, tiny Stat Mods for their Action Rolls. The failure also generates 1 Mayhem Point for the Bunker Master to use in their nefarious schemes later on.
