## Spending Badass Tokens

By attempting or executing Badass Moves, players earn Badass Tokens. Tokens can also be earned through certain Class/Archetype features. Badass Tokens can be used in a couple of ways. 
- They can be spent by any player in a party to add +1 to any roll, including non-combat Checks. 
- They can also be spent to do an additional Badass Move in an encounter. 

Each player gets 1 Badass Move per Pan'Dorah day, but can spend Tokens to do additional Badass Moves. 
Each extra Badass Move costs 1 additional Token cumulatively. 
- 1 extra move costs 1 Token
- The next costs 2 Tokens
- Then 3 Tokens
