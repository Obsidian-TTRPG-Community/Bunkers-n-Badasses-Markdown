## What Is A Badass Move?

Outside the realm of your normal Actions, the Badass Move is for all those do-or-die moments during a fight. When a player has a brilliant/stupid/courageous/nonsensical idea and desperately wants to put it into an Action, they'll be using a Badass Move. If they succeed, they'll get a bunch of stat buffs and feel like they could take on the world. If they fail… well, it’s gonna hurt.
