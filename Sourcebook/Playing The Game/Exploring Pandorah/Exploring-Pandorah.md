## Exploring Pan'Dorah

EXPLORING IS ONE of the most enjoyable things players can do in a tabletop RPG. Partially because a few well-placed sensory details can transport the human mind to wondrous, imaginary spaces, and partially because it makes the BM panic because they probably didn’t prepare anything outside of the one town and two dungeons they expected players to visit.

And when | say “explore,” | don't just mean spatially. Yes, players can poke around different areas to find secret treasures and shops and creatures, but… what if they explore a conversation with an NPC and end up discovering way more about their childhood? What if they explore the possibilities afforded to them by a really bizarre magical item that seems useless?

In my opinion, tabletop roleplaying is at its best when the focus isn't on “beating” the game, but about simply playing around -- walking down hidden paths, getting sidetracked, and losing yourself in the story.

**Long story short**: players shouldn't be afraid to tell the BM that they'd rather check out the tavern than go kill the big evil Boss.
