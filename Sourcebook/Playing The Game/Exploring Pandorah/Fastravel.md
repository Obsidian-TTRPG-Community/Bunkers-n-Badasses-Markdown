## Fastravel

Any town or castle or goblin enclave worth its salt will have a Fastravel Station for itself. Fastravel -- which is pronounced “fastravel” and not “fast travel,” because the former sounds more fantasy -- is a magical process by which one touches a Fastravel pole, has their body broken down into gajillions of particles and sent through the omnipresent magical ether, and is then recombined into its original form at their destination. Players can use Fastravel to instantly move around to locations they have already visited as the poles are only activated once a player has been there. It’s magic.

The Fastravel process *technically* results in the traveler's death (since, after all, your brain and heart stop functioning once they've been broken down into gajillions of tiny pieces); most who use the Fastravel system just try not to think about it.
