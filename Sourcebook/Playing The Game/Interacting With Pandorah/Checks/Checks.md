Checks are used to resolve most of the challenges outside of encounters, but also sometimes in encounters, too.

Checks can come up in two ways: either when a player describes something they wish to do that would require the Check (ex. a Soldier wants to see if there are any hidden Chests or passageways in the room, leading the BM to request a [[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Playing The Game/Interacting With Pandorah/Checks/Search Check|Search Check]]), or when the BM describes something the players must deal with that involves a Check (ex. after an explosion, a tree has fallen in the path of the siren as she is running towards an Enemy. The BM will have her roll a [[Github/Bunkers and Badasses/Sourcebook/Playing The Game/Interacting With Pandorah/Checks/Traverse Check|Traverse Check]] to avoid it).

## Resolving Checks

1. Player describes how they are going to attempt the Check.
2. The BM sets the difficulty of the Check. (The BM does not have to announce the difficulty to the player.)
3. The player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses they have for Checks of that type.
4. Compare the final result to the difficulty. The BM will describe the outcome of the Check.
5. A failed Check results in the generation of 1 Mayhem Point.

Some examples of when to use Checks and when it isn't necessary:
