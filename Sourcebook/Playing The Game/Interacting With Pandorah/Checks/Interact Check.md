## Interact Check

There are levers that need pulling, gates to be opened. And doors kicked in! Interact is all of these and anything else that needs to be handled. Thrown, or flail-ed about.

### Example Check Difficulty

**Pick Up Item: 5**
**Lift Gate: 10**
**Lift Building: 40**

### When To Use Interact Checks

- When picking up a mythical weapon and trying to avoid the trap mechanism.
- When frantically trying to disable the trap mechanism you just triggered.
- When a Vault Hunter is hungover and has to do literally anything.

### When Not To Use Interact Checks

- When a Vault Hunter is using an item they've used dozens of times before (except when hungover).
- When picking up items outside of combat or time sensitive moments.
