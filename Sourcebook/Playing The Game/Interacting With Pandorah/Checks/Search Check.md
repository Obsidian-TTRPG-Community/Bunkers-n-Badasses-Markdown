## Search Check

Unsure it you're walking into a trap? Suspect there might be some extra Loot hidden in a room? Why not perform, Search Check?

### Example Check Difficulty

**Find Loot: 5**
**Find Passages: 10**
**Find Purpose: 45**

### When To Use Search Checks

- When a Vault Hunter wants to find something hidden, like a secret pathway or item.
- When a Vault Hunter believes there is more Loot to find if they look hard enough.
- If there are tracks the Vault Hunter wants to follow.

### When Not To Use Search Checks

- When something is out in the open, like a door or item.
- When the Vault Hunter is trying to loot a non-dead Enemy (that'd be Sneak).
