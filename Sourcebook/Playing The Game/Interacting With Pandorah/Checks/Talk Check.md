## Talk Check

Going in guns blazing isn't always the answer. Sometimes you need to mount a charm offensive. There can be value in talking your way in or out of a situation.

### Example Check Difficulty

**Get Quest: 5**
**Lie to Guard: 10**
**Inception Guard: 28**

### When To Use Talk Checks

- When a Vault Hunter wishes to negotiate or intimidate. 
- When a Vault Hunter wishes to persuade or bluff.  
- When a Vault Hunter wishes to perform slam poetry.

### When Not To Use Talk Checks

- When a Vault Hunter is having a normal conversation about their elaborate backstory.
- When a Vault Hunter is yelling something during an encounter.
- If a Vault Hunter takes a vow of silence.
