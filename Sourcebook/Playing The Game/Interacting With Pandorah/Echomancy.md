Echomancy is an unexplainable magic, discovered by Echomancers, that allows Pan’Dorans to communicate over long distances. They communicate through the use of small, carved rune stones, referred to as Echo Stones. Echomancy allows the user to send and receive communications from any other Echo Stone holder. Echo Stones are prevalent throughout Pan’Dorah because the original Echomancers were so delighted with their invention they gave them out for free en masse. When it dawned on them that they could have made gajillions selling them, they became so distraught they immediately threw themselves into a volcano.

Their descendants, having learned from the earlier generation's folly, created a subscription-hased Echo Log system where users could upload pre-recorded messages on single-use rune stones. These Echo Logs became so popular that the second generation Echomancers became gajillionaires, but quickly realized money does not buy happiness; they, too, threw themselves into a volcano.
