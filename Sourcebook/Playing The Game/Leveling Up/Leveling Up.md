EACH TIME a Vault Hunter fills all 10 segments of their XP Bar with the requisite experience, they Level Up. When a Vault Hunter Levels Up, they get to do several exciting things. 

- First, change their Level on their Character Sheet. 
- Second, erase all previously earned XP and change the XP Bar segment (if their new Level requires a new segment value). 
- Third, and most exciting, they get to accept their rewards! 

To figure out what those rewards are, they will consult their Archetype Tree (see ***[Archetypes](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Creating%20a%20Vault%20Hunter/Archetypes/Archetypes.md)***).
