## Possible Rewards

### Skill Points

Each Level comes with a Skill Point to spend in the Skill Tree. At Level 1, only the first tier of Skills are available. Once the third Skill Point is selected in a tier, the next skill Tier is unlocked. The player can mark the lock icon on the next tier to signal that they can now place Skill

Points in that tier. Skill Level (SL) corresponds to the amount of Skill Points that are in that Skill (ex. If a player has 2 Skill Points in a Skill, it is considered SL2).

Most Skills can have a total of 3 Skill Points applied to them, while others can only have a single Skill Point.
If a Skill has "/SL' the effect is multiplied by the number of Skill Points in that Skill.

### +Health

Each Level, there is an increase to max Health. Players roll their Melee Die and add their MST Mod to the result. Players then add that number to their max Health and Current Health. No full heals here.

### Archetype Feats

At certain Levels depending on the Archetype, additional Archetype Feats can he selected. Some Feats have requirements like Level minimums, or prerequisite Feats, which can be found on the Archetype Feats chart.

### +Stat

Some Levels come with a stat increase. They could be general ‘+1 Stat’ or specific to a type of stat like ‘+1 SPD’. Any stat increase goes towards Base Stats which may increase the Stat Mod for that stat. (Reminder: Stat Mod is half of the Base Stat rounded down.)

### Favored Gun

New Favored Gun types are added several times throughout each Archetype Tree. Each additional Favored Gun increases Accuracy and Damage bonuses to all guns of that type. After selecting a new Favored Gun type, a player should mark it on their Character Sheet and update their Gun Cards.

### +Max Potions

At Level 9 for all Archetypes, storage capacity for potions increases by 1. Unlock a new slot in the "Potions" section on the Character Sheet. Another potion slot can be unlocked if a Vault Hunter Levels Up a second Archetype to Level 9.

### +Max Grenades

At Level 7, 19, and 23 for all Archetypes, storage capacity for grenades increases by 1. Update the max amount of grenade slots on the Character Sheet under the "Grenades" section.

### Crit Damage

If an Archetype Level adds Crit Damage, the player should make a note of the bonus Damage in the “Skills and Feats” section on their Character Sheet and possibly on any equipped Gun Cards. Any Crit performed will gain the added bonus Damage.
