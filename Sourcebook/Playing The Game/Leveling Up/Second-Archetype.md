## Second Archetype

Once a player reaches Level 5, they can choose to Level Up a second Archetype. By Leveling Up two different Archetypes, a player will have more versatility, but they may sacrifice Archetype Mastery. 
- If a second Archetype is selected, the player has the option of which Archetype to apply the Level increase. 
- The combined Archetype Levels make up the Vault Hunter's Level. 

So if a player is a Level 3 Deadeye and a Level 5 Enforcer, they have a Vault Hunter Level of 8.
