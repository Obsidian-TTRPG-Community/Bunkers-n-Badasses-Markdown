## Torgue

We're going to be straight with you: the Torque Corporation doesn't make any sense in the fictional world of Pan’Dorah. They're only here because the company’s spokesman, Mr. Torgue, demanded we put him in the rulebook. So, here you go. They make guns that cause explosions. You want a detailed backstory for them? You wanna know how they fit into the overall interfactional conflict that gives Pan’Dorah its flavor? Sorry. Torgue threatened to blow up our publishing office if we didn’t put his weapons in the game, so that’s all we're doing.
