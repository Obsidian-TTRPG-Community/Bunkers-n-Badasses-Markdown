## Moxx-Tails

These potions are made exclusively by Pan'Dorah’s resident mixologist herself, Mad Moxxi. They can be found at any Moxxi’s Grogg, but only when she is behind the bar; no way is she spilling her secrets. 

The cost varies based on her mood, which is typically dependent on the fullness of her tip jar. (Don't even think about tipping less than 10g.) Moxx-tails can be made to-go in a potion bottle, and behave the same way as a potion. 

Moxxi can sell a specific drink, or players can try their luck by rolling 1d10.
