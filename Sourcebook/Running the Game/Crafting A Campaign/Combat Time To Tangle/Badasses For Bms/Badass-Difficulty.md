## Badass Difficulty

When determining the difficulty of a Badass Move there are several things to take into account. 
- What is the surrounding environment? 
- How many additional Enemies stand in the way? 
- Are there other obstacles? 
- How many Actions are required and how achievable are they? 
- How close to the brink of death are the Vault Hunters, and do you want to give them a chance to pull off a heroic victory? 
When calculating difficulty, factor in the initiating player's move attempts and then add any assisting player's moves. A +6 difficulty per player is a good jumping-off point, but should scale based on Vault Hunter Levels and just how bonkers their assist moves are. 

You can consider all of the aforementioned suggestions, consult our chart of suggested difficulty modifiers, and do math calculations to determine a fair and balanced Badass Move difficulty -- OR you could say â€œah screw it, you are all super-charged on alien power ups and the difficulty is 5," because you really want to see how it all plays out. It's all up to you.
