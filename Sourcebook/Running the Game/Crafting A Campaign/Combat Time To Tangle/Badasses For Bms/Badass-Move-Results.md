## Badass Move Results

**Equal to or Greater than the Difficulty**: The player receives 4 Badass Tokens. Any assisting players receive 2 Badass Tokens. The Badass Move happens exactly as the player described, and they take the rest of their turn using the Base Stats (bigger stats) instead of the stat Mods (smaller stats).

**Less than Difficulty**: This is considered a fail and 1 Mayhem Point is gained. The player receives 2 Badass Tokens. Any assisting players receive 1 Badass Token. They should probably take a decent amount of Damage for their impudence, but they shouldn't have their whole turn wasted. Maybe their Attacks do less Damage, or their Movements are stopped early, or they fumble their one liner, but they should always make forward progress during their turn. You want to encourage these kinds of shenanigans.
