## Badass Rank Increase

You decide when the players have done something ‘badass enough’ to increase their Rank. This could be beating a tough Boss, gaining reputation as heroes across Pan’Dorah, Leveling Up after a long session, or performing a Badass Move with such Baddassitude that you are kinda legally obligated to increase your group's Badass Rank as a result. There is no limit to how high a Badass Rank can go, but as a general rule Badass Rank should be around half of a Vault Hunter's Level or they will become super OP and get huge heads and become insufferable.
