## Badasses for BMs

Badass Moves are a way for players to stretch there very thin threads of reality that hold Panâ€™Dorah together. It is also a way for them to  
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! Nothing should be out-of-bounds for a Badass Move. Impossible, incomprehensible, and even incorrigible Actions should not only be encouraged but celebrated.
