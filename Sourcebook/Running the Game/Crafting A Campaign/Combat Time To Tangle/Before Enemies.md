## Before Enemies

Players Acting Before Enemies can determine play order amongst themselves, giving them greater options in combat teamwork.

On a player's turn, they will narrate what their character is doing (ex. “Commando is going to run up to the Orc Bushwhacker, and fire his Pistol at them. He's then going to drink a Shield Potion while running towards his allies in the fight.”). While narrating, the player incorporates the Actions they wish to perform that turn:

| **Actions**               | **Actions that Generate Mayhem** |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Move                  | Extra Movement               |
| Attack                | Extra Attack                 |
| Activate Action Skill | Swap Guns                    |
| Throw                 | Attempt a Check              |
| Drink a Potion        | Handoff Item                 |
|                       | Reload                             |

## Normal Actions

During a Vault Hunter's turn, they can do any/all of the following once in any order:

### MOVE

Move a number of squares equal to the player's Movement (3 squares + SPD Mod).

### ATTACK

Make a Ranged or Melee Attack against a target within Range.

### ACTIVATE ACTION SKILL

Instead of Attacking on a turn, a player may activate their character's Action Skill. A player may not use Extra Attacks on the same turn they activate an Action Skill.

### THROW

Throw an item or grenade.

### DRINK A POTION

Consume a potion.

## Mayhem Generators

Vault Hunters can optionally do any/all of the following for the price of generating 1 Mayhem Point (B).

### EXTRA MOVEMENT

Move a number of squares equal to the player's Movement (3 squares + SPD Mod).

### EXTRA ATTACK

Make a Ranged or Melee Attack against a target within Range.

### SWAP GUNS

A player swaps their current gun for another equipped gun.

### ATTEMPT A CHECK

Failing the Check will result in gaining 2 total Mayhem Points.

### HANDOFF ITEM

Hand an item to an adjacent target.

### RELOAD

A Reload occurs when a player attempts a Ranged Attack and rolls a 1 on their Accuracy Roll. A player may also choose to skip their Attack and Reload for a benefit from things like Archetype Feats.

All Actions can be performed in the order of the player's choice, but a Vault Hunter may not make a regular Attack and then activate their Action Skill during the same turn.

A player may also Hold Actions instead of taking normal Actions on their turn. If a player is choosing to ==Hold Actions==<span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">*</span> they are waiting  
to act until a specific requirement is met and then they take their entire Turn at that time. They cannot take some actions in their normal Initiative and then Hold the rest of their Actions. This could  be waiting until another party member takes their turn to set up a Badass Teamwork Move or until an Enemy moves close to that cliff  so they can shove them off it. If a player is Holding Actions until a specific event and that event never occurs, they take their turn last during the After Enemies step.
