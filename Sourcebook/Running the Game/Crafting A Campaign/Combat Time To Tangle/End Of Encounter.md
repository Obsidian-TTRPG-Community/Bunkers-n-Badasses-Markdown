## End of Encounter

Once the encounter is over, the BM will tally up the XP gained from each Enemy defeated. XP is equal to 10x the total Badass Rank of all defeated Enemies. 

For example, if a party defeats a group of 5 bandits each with a BR of 3, each member of the party would gain 150 XP. Each Vault Hunter gains XP for all Enemies slain in the encounter. Enemies defeated generate Loot Piles in the square they're slain in; the amount of Loot Piles dropped is based off Enemy BR.
