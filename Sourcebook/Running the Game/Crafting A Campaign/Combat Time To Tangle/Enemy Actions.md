## Enemy Actions

All Enemies will take Actions in this phase, starting with the highest Badass Rank to lowest. 
- A good first turn move for Enemies is their topmost Action. 
- They can move to get into Range if they aren't already
- or they can attempt another Action. 
- If you spent Mayhem on Enemy Mayhem Actions, the Enemies will use their Mayhem Actions instead of normal Actions this turn. 
You can decide to have an Enemy take both of their Actions during a turn, as long as one is an Attack and one is not. 

To see all the things you can do with Mayhem in and out of combat, see Mayhem in the ***[Mayhem](Github/Bunkers%20and%20Badasses/Sourcebook/Running%20the%20Game/Mayhem%20Makes%20Memories.md)*** section. 

When Enemies take Attack Actions, roll 1d20 and subtract the Speed (SPD) Mod of their target to see how well their Attack resolves.

1: Attack fails. For fun, describe how and why the Enemy wasn't successful. Make it embarrassing.  
2-7: the Attack deals normal Damage.  
8-15: the Attack deals +2 Damage.
16-19: the Attack deals +4 Damage.  
20: the Attack is a Critical success and deals double Damage. ] Mayhem Point is gained.
