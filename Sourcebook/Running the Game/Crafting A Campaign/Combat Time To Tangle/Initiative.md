## Initiative

Have the players roll for Initiative and compare it to the Badass Rank of the Enemies to create the Initiative order. Players will roll 1d20 and add their SPD Mod and Badass Rank (BR) to their roll.

All Enemies Act at the same time. The Enemy with the highest Badass Rank determines the Initiative for all Enemies.

Players with equal or higher Badass Rank than the Enemies will Act during the Before Enemies step. Conversely, players with a lower Badass Rank than the Enemies will Act during the After Enemies step.
