## Player Deaths

Now -let’s imagine you've killed a player. While they're busy finding imaginative profanity to use against you, their character will he sent straight to the BREW-U revivification device. Unfortunately, the BREW-U doesn’t always bring Vault Hunters back as they were: they'll tend to come back with some form of Trauma.

It is entirely at your discretion whether a player suffers a Temporary Trauma or a Permanent one. Your typical run of the mill death at the hands of some basic Enemies should probably earn a Temp Trauma, whereas a grotesque, painful death by a Big Bad could warrant a Perma Trauma. Or maybe the player did something really, really dumb. Then hit ‘em with the bad one.

If players are masochists and love to die, maybe after 5 Permanent Trauma-worthy deaths, just give them what they want and kill them for good. <span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">EMBRACE THE VOID  BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</span>
