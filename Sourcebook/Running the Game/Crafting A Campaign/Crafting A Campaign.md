## Crafting A Campaign

WHETHER YOU ARE creating a new adventure or leading a group through a pre-made campaign, there are steps you can take to craft the experience around the play style of your players. If they tend to be more interested in role-playing and acting, you can center the adventure around character development and NPC engagement. For those who are in it for the combat and Loot, there are a plethora of Enemies and guns to throw at them. Whatever play style fits your group, it is on you as the BM, to provide that bespoke experience.
