## Boss Actions

Each Boss should have their own Stat Block, the same as a regular Enemy does. The Boss takes Actions as normal, but their Actions should be powerful. Think of it as the Boss Actions are always Mayhem Actions. A good Boss will have a few tricks up their sleeve, but should follow a pattern that the players can pick up on. Making Bosses that are a bit predictable gives the players a sense of progress, even when they are getting the crap kicked out of them.

When creating Boss Actions, make sure they won't single out any particular Vault Hunter. The Boss wants to take down ALL the players and should be Attacking them almost equally. If a player is advancing on the Boss faster then you wish, send in some minions to pull their focus.
