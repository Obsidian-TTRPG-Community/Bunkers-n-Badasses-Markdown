## Boss Defense

Bosses will not just stand there and take Damage like normal Enemies in an encounter. Each Boss should have a ‘Defense’ or ‘Immortal’ mode, where they take no Damage (or greatly reduced Damage) until a specific trigger occurs. That trigger could be at the end of a turn, when the players interact with something, or if they shoot a weak point on the Boss.

These modes could be the default mode for the Boss. Perhaps they take reduced Damage for 2 turns, then their spell breaks, and they have to spend the next turn recharging it. If a Boss has a Defense mode, they should also have a mode where they take extra Damage. When making a Boss, the players should be able to learn about their weaknesses or defenses during their adventures either through NPCs or maybe even hints from the Boss themselves. Allow players opportunities to learn more about the Boss and reward them for the knowledge in combat. Maybe they learn the Crit spots or maybe they learn how to limit Defense mode.
