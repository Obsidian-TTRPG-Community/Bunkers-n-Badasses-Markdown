## Minions

Each Boss should have a few minions around to help distract the players. These can be Enemy types the players have fought before in this campaign, or new threats the player must deal with. Maybe as your aquatic Boss is taking Damage, their fins are getting shot off, and they become sentient and Attack the players by rushing at them and flapping at their face. Why did you create a Boss with so many fins?

The goal of the minions is to add pressure to the players while also giving them targets for easier kills to activate Skills or abilities. They could come in waves at specific intervals of the fight, or could be triggered by certain events (like a Boss entering or exiting defense mode or when they take a certain amount of Damage). Their Actions should be quick and simple, so the Boss remains the focus of the encounter.
