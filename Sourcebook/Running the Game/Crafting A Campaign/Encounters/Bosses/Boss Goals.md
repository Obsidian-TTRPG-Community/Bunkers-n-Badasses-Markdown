## Boss Goals

Everyone is the hero of their own story, including Boss Enemies. As such, they will be attempting to achieve secret goals that accomplish their own missions. These are behind-the-scenes events that you can implement by spending Mayhem Points. 
- Maybe the Boss destroys a weapons depot along the Vault Huntersâ€™ path, eliminating their opportunity to trade up their guns. 
- Or maybe they go to a neutral town, schmooze the citizens, become mayor, and perma-ban the Vault Hunters from ever entering. 

The Vault Hunters should be affected by the Goals of your Bosses, either directly or indirectly. It is on you to create a list of Goals for the Boss and rank each one on how difficult that Goal will be to complete by assigning it a Mayhem cost.
