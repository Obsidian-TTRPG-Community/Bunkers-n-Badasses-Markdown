## Bosses

Great heroes require great villains.

Bosses are created to challenge and foil players. Be they end-Boss or mini-Boss, they could be around for a single session or as the main antagonist of your entire campaign. Whether they're meant to sustain multiple hours or just be an interesting bit of cannon fodder for the afternoon, make sure to craft your Bosses such that they're dripping with personality. A memorable villain can save a campaign from an otherwise mundane story (I am not implying your story is mundane… *I would never*). If you can create a Boss whom your players really, really want to shoot in the face, that’s kind of all you need to keep your players invested.

This section is guidance on creating a Boss.
