## Combat Areas

You should begin every encounter with a detailed description of the setting and layout of the combat area. What are the Vault Huntersâ€™ positions in relation to the Enemies? What obstacles or objects are found in the space? Does the area have any special mechanics like lava fissures that shoot up or shrinking walls?

A good rule to follow is that each encounter should give players opportunities for clever play and teamwork. Encounters fought on multi-level terrain immediately set players up to proceed in different ways. The sniper may hang back to pick them off, or climb to high ground to force the Enemies towards the Damage dealers. Strategic placement of interactable objects also enhances encounter areas.
