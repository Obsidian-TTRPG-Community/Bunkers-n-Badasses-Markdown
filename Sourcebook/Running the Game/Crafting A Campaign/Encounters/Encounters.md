## Encounters

Encounters are the “B” in the Vault Hunting BLT (the “L’ is “Loot” and the “T” is “Tfriendship”). Encounters occur when the characters and Enemies meet and decide to resolve their differences in combat. An encounter plays out with Vault Hunter and Enemy Actions until one or ==both sides are defeated.== <span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans">mutually assured destruction YUSSSSSSSSSSSS</span>
