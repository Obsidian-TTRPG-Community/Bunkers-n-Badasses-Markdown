## Badass Enemies

Like normal Enemies, except faster, stronger, and more full of murder.

All Enemy types have Badasses, so when spawning Enemies you can always choose to spawn a Badass of the Enemy type by calculating double the Badass Rank. For example, a Badass Skeleton would have a Badass Rank of 6 instead of the normal Skeleton BR of 3. 

Badass Enemies also have double the Health/Armor and only take Mayhem Actions. Additionally, they get a modifier from the table below, rolled at random or chosen by the BM.
