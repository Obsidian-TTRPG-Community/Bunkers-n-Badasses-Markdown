## Enemies' Special Rules

If an Enemy has Special Rules, any time a Vault Hunter experiences their Special Rules, they should be given a chance to discover the changes. 

The BM will have the Vault Hunter make an Insight (9) Check; if successful, the BM will describe what appears to be happening with the Special Rule (ex. if a Vault Hunter Melee Attacks a Brittle Bones and succeeds their Insight Check, the BM will describe how the blow seems to be cracking the glowing blue bones of the creatures as they reel back from the Hit).
