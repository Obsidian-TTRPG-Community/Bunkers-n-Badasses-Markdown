## Spawning Enemies

Each encounter that Vault Hunters face is created and balanced around the Quests they take. If an encounter has a spawn table, the BM will use it to spawn Enemies into the area based on the Quest Level.

**Spawn 7 Badass Rank (BR) per Vault Hunter**

| **Enemy**                      | **BR**  |
| -------------------------- | --- |
| Skeleton                   | 5   |
| Skeleton Archer            | 4   |
| Immortal Skeletaur (Max 1) | 7   |

If there were 3 Vault Hunters in your party, the BM would spawn a total of 21 Badass Rank worth of Enemies into the environment (7 per Vault Hunter). In some cases, the Enemy list will have guidelines like the ‘Max 1° of the Immortal Skeletaur. (ex. 2 Skeletons, 1 Skeleton Archer, and 1 Immortal Skeletaur equal 21 BR.) 

If the BM finds they cannot spawn Enemies that add up evenly to the Badass Rank total, they can choose to either end under the total (easier encounter) or go over the total (harder encounter).
