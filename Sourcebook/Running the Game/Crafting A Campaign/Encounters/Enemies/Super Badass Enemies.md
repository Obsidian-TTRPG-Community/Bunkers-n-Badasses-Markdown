Super Badass Enemies are an even greater threat than regular Badass Enemies as they possess increased speed, strength, and lethality. To spawn a Super Badass of an enemy type, multiply the Badass Rank (BR) by three when spawning enemies.

`Badass Rank * 2 = "Badass" Badass Rank`
`Badass Rank * 3 = Super Badass Rank`

For instance, if you want to spawn a Super Badass Skeleton, the BR would be 9, which is three times the normal Skeleton BR of 3. 
- Similarly, dragons will also triple their BR, resulting in dragons of ***BR 63***. ðŸ˜¨

Super Badass Enemies also have the following compared to their normal, unbadass counterparts:
- Size Changes:
    - Medium-sized enemies gain triple the Base Health, Armor, and Shields.
    - Large-sized enemies gain quadrupled the Base health, Armor, and Shields.
- All Enemies will gain Shields and Armor Equal to 1/2 SuperBadass Health if they did not have Shields and Armor before
- Super Badass Enemies are not pulling any punches, and use Actions ***and*** Mayhem Actions freely. ðŸ’€

Additionally, they get **two** modifiers from the sourcebook's [[WyrmGamemaster/BnB/Sourcebook/Running the Game/Crafting A Campaign/Encounters/Enemies/Badass Enemies#^BnB-Traits-Enemy|Badass Enemies]] Trait Table or any homebrewed Enemy Trait Table, rolled at random or chosen by the Bunkermaster, whomever is *more sadistic*.
