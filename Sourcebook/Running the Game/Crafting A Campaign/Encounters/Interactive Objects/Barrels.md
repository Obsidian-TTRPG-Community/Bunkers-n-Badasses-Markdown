## Barrels

Empty Barrels can offer limited Cover in combat. They can also hold a variety of Elements, like Corrosive, Shock, Incendiary, Cryo, or Explosive, that can be blasted or hurled to inflict Damage.

**Thrown**
- If a Barrel is Thrown, it smashes on contact with the ground or an Enemy's head. 

**Breaking**
Breaking a Barrel requires some amount of force decided on by you: either by Hitting it, which seems ill-advised, or by shooting it. 

The force of the break causes 3d6 Splash Damage of the Element type plus the Element's effect (see page 81) to all adjacent squares and creates a puddle of the Element in the Barrel's square. Any target that enters the square with the Element puddle takes 1d6 Damage of the Element type plus Element effect. 

As BM, you can determine how long any given Element lasts on a square. Is it the length of an encounter or is the landscape forever altered?
