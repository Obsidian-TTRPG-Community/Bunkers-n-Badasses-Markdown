## Debris

Anything can become a weapon in the heat of battle: from planks of splintered wood to wall sconces to massively heavy books of Panâ€™ Doran Spiderant recipes.

When populating a combat area with objects, make sure to note the mechanics the objects will utilize, like Elemental Damage, Cover, or defense, as applicable.
