## Environments

When fantasizing about the world of PanDorah, and really as just a mental escape from the drudgeries of life, | often look out the window of my cubicle here at Atlas, at the bleak yet varied landscapes of Pandora and imagine them with vast castles and keeps, surrounded by dark, uninviting forests and swamps. But thatâ€™s me. Your fantasy can be whatever you want it to be. The important thing is to make sure whatever environments or areas you lead your players through are well-crafted and populated with enough NPCs, Enemies, and items to keep them entertained and having fun.
