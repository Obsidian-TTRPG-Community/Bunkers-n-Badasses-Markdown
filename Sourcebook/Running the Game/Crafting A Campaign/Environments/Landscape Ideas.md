## Landscape Ideas

**Caustic Lake**: A puddle of acidic waste. Hazardous to Vault Hunters, but home to horrifying, corrosion-spitting baddies.

**Lava Volcano**: Nothing says “climactic showdown’ like a volcano with a winding path up its circumference. The lip of the volcano is a perfect place to put your endboss -especially if you make him fall into the lava afterward and enter his second phase as a gargantuan magma golem.

**Salt Flats**: Flat. Salty. Good for vehicle chases and sudden attacks from thirsty bandits. Thirsty as in “parched,” not as in “hey u up”.

**Pleasant Meadow**: Where wild Butt Stallions graze. A majestic, windswept plain full of flowers, tall grass, and singing birds. You should probably only bring players here if your villain is about to burn the entire place to the ground.

**Windshear Shelf**: Cold, windy, and full of bandits wearing puffy coats. The environment is as much of an Enemy as the monsters.

**Boneyard**: Dead stuff! Almost-dead stuff! Stuff-that-used-to-bedead-but-isn't! Don’t get bitten.
