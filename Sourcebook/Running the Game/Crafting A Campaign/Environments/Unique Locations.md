## Unique Locations

**Skag-Drawn Carriage Station**: Pan’‘Dorah’s wealthier travelers prefer to travel within the protection of armored carriages, which are in turn pulled by a stable of de-toothed skags.

>[!TINA] Tea and Crumpet House
> If you hungry or angry or wanna fight or wanna flirt or a wanna eat a good food, then deffo go to a tea and crumpet house. Get fulla crumpets, then get fulla punches. it get rowdy at the crumpet house.

**Dr. Ted’s Apothecary**: Despite the fact that he never successfully graduated from the Pan’Dorah College of Clerics, Dr. Ted provides his customers with shields, heals, and -if you ask him about his backstory -feels.

**Claptrap’s Clapo Trap House**: It’s a dance club run by a Claptrap unit. Do not ever set a scene here.

**Decaying Ruins**: Pretty much every fantasy setting has a bunch of decaying ruins everywhere, and with good reason: they're really useful, narratively speaking. Wanna explain where a great item came from? Maybe it was made by the lost civilization that lived in these ruins. Wanna set up a bad guy? Hundreds of years ago, this kingdom was great…until the baddie came through and turned it all into RUINS. 

**Landship**: Someone was very, very bad at parking.
