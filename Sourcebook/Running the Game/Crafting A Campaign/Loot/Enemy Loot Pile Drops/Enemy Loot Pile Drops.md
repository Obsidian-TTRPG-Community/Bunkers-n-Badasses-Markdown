## Enemy Loot Pile Drops

<span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans;style">You gotta dig for it. ðŸ’©</span>
Using the Enemy Badass Rank as a guide, place a number of Loot Piles in the square after an Enemy is killed. If a<span style="color: hotpink;font-family: Gill Sans;style">^</span> Vault Hunter enters a square with Loot Piles, roll 1d4 for each Pile in that square. (ex. an Enemy with a BR of 15 would drop 4 Loot Piles. When a player enters the square where the Piles dropped, they would roll 4d4 and use the Enemy Drop Table to locate the items they found.)
