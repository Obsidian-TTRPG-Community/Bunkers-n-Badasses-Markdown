## Loot

BUNKERS & BADASSES is a looter-shooter RPG. Vault Hunters have done the shooting; now it’s time to reward them with looting. Loot can be many types of things; guns, Shields, potions, guns, relics, cash, guns. Don't be afraid to be overly generous with Loot, especially really cool guns. This is Pan’Dorah, after all. It is nothing if not chock full of guns.
