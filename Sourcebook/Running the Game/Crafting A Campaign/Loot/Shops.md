## Shops

Throughout their adventures, Vault Hunters are likely to stumble on the occasional shop or market stand. They can be very specific stalls that perhaps specialise in nothing but Torgue Rocket Launchers or they can be catch-alls that sell anything and everything. 

Consider what items you want to make available to the players, along with when and where. 

Here are some guidelines on pricing, but as with everything, feel free to scale however you deem best.

| **Item**  | Common | Uncommon | rare | Epic  | Legendary |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ---- | ----- | --------- |
| **Gun**   | 50g    | 80g      | 120g | 180g  | 300g      |
| **Relic** | 100g   | 250g     | 500g | 1000g | 2500g     |
