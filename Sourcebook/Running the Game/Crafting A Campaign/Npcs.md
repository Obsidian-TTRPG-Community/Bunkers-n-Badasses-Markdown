## NPCs

The world of Bunkers & Badasses is filled with unique characters from all around Panâ€™Dorah and beyond. These characters, controlled by the BM, are referred to as Non-Player Characters, or NPCs.

NPCs can be literally anything you imagine. A talking fern that wants to cover the world in his spores? Sure. A friendly dragon who just wants to cuddle, but stops himself from crushing his cuddlebuddies in his sleep? Go for it.

It is nearly impossible to understate the importance of NPCs to your campaign. NPCs aren't just a way for you to directly interact with your players, they're also walking buckets of story possibilities in and of themselves. Do your players fall in love with a particular NPC you've created? Great -now put that NPC in danger, and watch your players fall over themselves to protect them. Alternately -do your players really despise a particular NPC that you wanted them to like? Feel free to pivot and make that character a villain.

When creating NPCs, you may be tempted to come up with pages and pages of backstory for them. You don't need to do this. Your NPC just needs some (A) quirks, which the tables on the next page will provide; (B) a desire, ideally one that involves the player characters in some way; and (C), a goofy voice.

C is non-negotiable. If your NPCs don't have weird voices, you're not playing a tabletop role playing game.

If you're suffering from a creative block and want some help, feel free to roll up a random NPC using the table below.
