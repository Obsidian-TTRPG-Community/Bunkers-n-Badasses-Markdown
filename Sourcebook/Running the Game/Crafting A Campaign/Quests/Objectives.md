## Objectives

Objectives are the initiatives required to complete a Quest. Quests can have several objectives each with multiple steps. If an NPC commissions the Vault Hunters to eliminate the Bone Lord, the main objective would be “defeat the Bone Lord” but the players may need to visit more than one location or complete a few tasks to accomplish their goal. 

When making objectives, be careful to not be too specific or prescriptive in what you're asking of the players. Much of the fun in roleplaying games comes from watching your players solve problems in ways you didn’t expect. So instead of “murder the Bone Lord,” maybe your objective is “stop the Bone Lord from harassing Flamerock Refuge.” Yeah, there's a 99% chance your players will just murder the Bone Lord anyway because all RPG players are psychopaths, but there’s always that one player in your party who wants to seduce and marry the Bone Lord instead. And they should totally be able to do that. 

Just think of the bone puns, for god’s sake.
