## Quest Levels and Rewards

All Quests require a Quest Level. This drives the difficulty of the encounters and the degree of rewards, should the players succeed. For balance, you can average all playersâ€™ Levels to determine Quest Level. But no one is going to know the skill level or constitution of your group better than you, so adjust the Quest Level as you see fit.

For groups with more than 4 Vault Hunters, the BM may wish to reduce the XP rewards from Quests to make sure the party progresses at a steady pace.
