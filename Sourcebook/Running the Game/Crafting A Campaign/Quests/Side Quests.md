## Side Quests

These can be collected from NPCs or just appear in the world naturally, but these are additional, optional misadventures your players can get into. They can be used to give more depth to the world and its characters, flesh out the main story and its stakes, or just be a fun excuse to shoot more things.

Any major town should have its own Bounty Board where Vault Hunters can find those in need of help, and charge them for it. If you want to create seemingly random Quests that have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the main story you can easily just throw them up on the Bounty Board with no explanation necessary.

If you are not feeling particularly inventive, use the chart to roll up a random Side Quest.
