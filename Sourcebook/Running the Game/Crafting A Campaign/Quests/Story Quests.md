## Story Quests

These form the backbone of your campaign. Story Quests will drive your players along your meticulously planned adventure, allowing them to journey through an epic, emotionally gripping story.

Just kidding. These are the Quests your players will spend an entire session ignoring because you accidentally mentioned one of the wizards in the tavern was named “Dunk Balla” and suddenly they want to play Bunkers & Basketball so you really quickly make up some rules about how basketball works in this system (you're like, “uh, | guess treat the hoop like a creature and make Ranged Attacks on it -or, no, yeah, in this world basketball hoops are actual monsters that eat bombs, and so you can only defeat them by lobbing grenades, and whoever defeats their hoop monster wins the game, | guess”) while staring at your two pages of meticulously typed notes and story beats and slowly growing angrier at yourself for ever believing your players would be even remotely interested in the story you wanted to tell.

But you still need to have these. Without Story Quests, your players will feel directionless, and that never feels good. Once they have a clear story hook driving them through your campaign, they'll feel empowered to brutally ignore and subvert that story at every turn -which is totally fine, and part of the fun of role-playing. Just, you know. Don't be surprised when it happens. And maybe take some improv classes so you can roll with the punches.
