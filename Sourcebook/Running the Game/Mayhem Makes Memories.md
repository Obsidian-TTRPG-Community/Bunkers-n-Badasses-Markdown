## Mayhem Makes Memories

Vault Hunters are designed to create Mayhem. It is in the very fabric of their being. So as BM, you get to harness that Mayhem and use it against them. Think of Mayhem as a type of currency. Vault Hunters’ Actions gain you Mayhem Points that you get to spend causing trouble. Mayhem is designed to allow the BM the freedom to balance the game as you see fit. The general idea behind the system is that as players adventure and battle, they will be gaining experience and mastery, and as BM you will want to be able to increase the challenge levels accordingly. Spending Mayhem Points is entirely at your discretion. If combat seems too easy for the group, using Mayhem Points on Mayhem Actions or additional waves of Enemies will ramp up difficulty.

Add 1 point to your Mayhem tally each time any of the following Actions occur (pay attention because all of these things will happen often and you want to make sure to gain those sweet, sweet Mayhem Points):
- If any player ever fails a Check inside or outside of an encounter.
- If, during an encounter, any player:
- Hands Off an item to an adjacent target
- Takes any Extra Movement or Extra Attack - Reloads or swaps out a gun
- Attempts a Check
- Fails a Badass Move
- An Enemy rolls a Crit (20).

Once you have accumulated a stack of Mayhem Points, here is how you can spend them to create your own Mayhem back.
- 1 point: Execute 1 Enemy's Mayhem Action instead of their normal Action.
- 2 points: Send in another wave of Enemies equaling half the encounter's total Badass Rank. You can slice this pie anyway you want. You can add a slew of low rank Enemies, one mini-Boss, or a combination platter. (I might be hungry.)
- 2 points: 1 Enemy that would die this turn takes a Mayhem Action before death.
- 3 points: All Enemies take a Mayhem Action instead of their normal Actions, or Boss Enemies take an Extra Action.
- X points: Complete a Boss Goal. (see
