## Mayhem Rando Table

**\* 1 point: I do wat I want**:  Roll on the Randostuffs table!

### Randostuffs

If you wanna get a little cray and go buttwild, use this table instead of the other (boring) stuff over there. Just roll a hundo die (as in, two ten sided die obv, don't roll a hundo actual die… or maybe do?) and do the thingy the dies say.
