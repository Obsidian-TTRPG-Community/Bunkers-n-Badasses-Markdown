## Running The Game

IF YOU'RE JUST going to PLAY Bunkers & Badasses, you DO NOT need to read any of this. (bye)

This section is all for the Bunker Masters, and will provide a bunch of tips for crafting a compelling Quest, story hooks you can outright steal, and ways you can make your life a whole lot easier.

Being a Bunker Master is no small task, but it’s also not quite as intimidating as it may initially seem. Hopefully, with some help from this book, you'll be your friends’ imagination-dom in no time at all.
