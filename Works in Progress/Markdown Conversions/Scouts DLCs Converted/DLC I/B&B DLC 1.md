**[My Editing Notes:]**

Things in Red are skills that affect your Max HP.

Things in Orange are skills that deal with your Action Skill.

Things in Yellow are skills that boost your stats and checks.

Things in Green are skills that grant Health Regen.

Things in Blue are skills that interact with Shields.

Things in Purple are skills that deal with a recurring feature. (Agent:
A specific [Gadget]. Beastmaster: Your chosen
[Familiar]. Gunner: [Mounted Weapons]. Siren:
[Siren Element].)\
Skills marked with an \* Asterisk next to their name are
"One-Point-Wonders" that have a max SL of 1.

**[(And things in *gorgeous* hot pink, with the black highlights, and
the handwriting font are comments from ya' gurl, Tina!)]**

I added in the color-coded notes as a way to help track the balancing of
the classes. I didn't want to give them *too much* of certain effects,
and not enough of others. As it stands, official classes usually only
have 1-2 healing abilities, with 3 at the most, and any class with a
+Health ability only gets 10+MST Mod/SL health with a max of 3 SL, so I
tried to keep it close to that, with *Phasetrance* Siren being the big
exception. (Amara actually *does* have multiple health-up abilities, to
Moze's *none*.)

There probably are still some balance issues, but that's going to happen
with any homebrew that isn't playtested to the vault and back, and I've
made all these off second-hand knowledge and snippets from DeLaBamba's
discord server while my book ships. (Delivery date is the same day I'm
writing this.)

As I learn more about the system, how to balance homebrew, and what are
*"appropriate"* amounts of damage at each level for a
Borderlands-inspired game (Where numbers often reach the "K" and "M"
digits, and are designed to make you *feel* like a Badass.) more content
for Vehicles will be added, such as established vehicles like the Light
Runner, Bandit Technical, and Cyclone, as well as new ones such as the
seven-passenger "Party Wagon" and 'living' vehicles, like the Devils
found on Gehenna. (The *actual* Devils, not the centaur-bike version…
though that too.)

Ever want to Drive a Dragon?

Until that time, I hope you enjoy the content found here, and stay tuned
for future updates and additions. This is all a labor of love for the
franchise and the game, and I appreciate all the comments you might have
about things I've included.

Rando-Mancers are so embroiled in the chaos of their life, they don't

**[Vehicles]**

Sometimes, walking sucks. Okay, a lot of the time walking sucks.
Especially when you gotta walk *really, really far*. That's why we
invented the carriage! Or rode horses! Or made *cars*!

Well, as soon as we figured out how to do all that, we figured out how
to *strap guns to that stuff and blow each other up with them*.

Where was I going with this? Oh! Right! Vehicles in your ***game***. So!
Vehicles come in all shapes and sizes, and have different amounts of
people that can ride in or on 'em, in different seats that do different
things. This is gonna show you how to do all that, or at least *my* way
to do it.

Firstly, Vault Hunters get a new encounter action that deals
specifically with when you *aren't* in a vehicle, but *want to be*.
**[(Gotta get that vroom VROOM, boi!)]**

**Carjack**

If you aren't already in a vehicle, you can spend your movement to get
into one that isn't being driven.

If someone *is* driving that thing, make a Carjack Traverse Check. If
you succeed, you toss that bozo out onto the ground, and deal Melee
Damage to them as a parting gift. **[(If you are lucky, it will part
them. Part of them over here, part of them over there, you get the
idea.)]**

If you succeed at carjacking a car that someone is already driving, you
generate 1 mayhem. If you *fail*, you generate 2 mayhem and you take
Melee Damage from *them* as they manage to hit you and stop you from
jacking their ride. No mayhem for hopping in an empty ride though.
**[(Unless you do it too much. I'm watching you…)]**

Once you're in a car, things change up a *lot*. Your encounter actions
change depending on what seat you're driving, and each vehicle has
different seats and armor and speeds and stuff, but they'll all follow
the basic template for a vehicle, based on a combination of its
[Frame] and [Parts]. Also, you can't be shot or
stabbed or exploded while in a vehicle, it will take all the damage for
the people driving or riding it.

**Armor**: The amount of Armor a vehicle has. Even living vehicles have
armor. A Frame will list what types of armor you can install.

**Repair**: Functions like Health Regen or Shield Recharge, but for your
ride's armor. Based on the Frame.

**Size**: How big of a truck you're driving. Based on the Frame.
[**~~(And not at all indicative of the size of your various bits, I
promise.)~~**]

**Movement**: How many spaces a vehicle can move each turn. Based on the
Tires, Armor, and Booster.

**Boost Meter**: The number of times your vehicle can Boost each
encounter. You regain 1 charge every 3 rounds you go without Boosting,
up to the vehicle's maximum.

**Seats**: How many people can cram into or atop a ride, and what they
can do there. Based on the Frame.

**Slam**: How much damage your vehicle does when you run someone over.
Based on Armor and Frame.

**Parts**: List of available Parts you can swap out on the Frame.

**[Driving]**

There are three types of Seats to pilot in a vehicle: Driver, Gunner,
and Passenger, each has their own list of encounter actions you can only
do from your seat. ***(Note, if a vehicle lists a special action you can
perform, that takes precedence over these rules.)***

**Driver (Weapon)**: You control where the vehicle goes. Each turn, you
get the following encounter actions:

-   **Drive**: Move the vehicle up to its movement. Driving through an
    enemy's space can *Slam* them.

> \- To *Slam*, roll a D20. **1**: You miss. *(Generates 1 mayhem.)*
> **2-15**: Deal the vehicle's *Slam* damage. **16+**: +1 Damage die.
> **20**: Deal max *Slam* damage. (*Slamming* doesn't add ACC or DMG
> bonuses to rolls.)

-   **Boost**: The vehicle makes an Extra Movement. *(Generates 1
    mayhem.)* If you *Slam* while Boosting, the *Slam* deals double
    damage and is Explosive.

-   **Attack**: If the Driver has a weapon listed, fire this weapon. All
    vehicle weapons are favored.

-   **Extra Attack**: Make an Extra Attack with the vehicle's weapon, if
    it has one. *(Generates 1 mayhem.)*

-   **Dismount**: Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.

-   **Exchange**: Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with
    another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. *(Generates 1
    mayhem.)*

**Gunner (Weapon)**: You man the vehicle's mounted turret weapon, and
have the following encounter action while in the vehicle:

-   **Attack**: Attack with the vehicle's turret weapon. All vehicle
    weapons are favored.

-   **Extra Attack**: Make an Extra Attack with the vehicle's turret
    weapon. *(Generates 1 mayhem.)*

-   **Dismount**: Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.

-   **Exchange**: Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with
    another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. *(Generates 1
    mayhem.)*

**Passenger**: Just along for the ride, you get to act the most freely,
retaining many of your normal encounter actions. Any action that
normally generates mayhem *outside* a vehicle still generates mayhem
*inside* the vehicle.

-   **Attack**: Attack with your equipped gun, or Melee Attack someone
    adjacent to your seat.

-   **Extra Attack**: Make an Extra Attack.

-   **Grenade**: Toss a Grenade.

-   **Throw**: Throw an item to someone, inside or outside the vehicle
    doesn't matter.

-   **Drink a Potion**: Take a sip, babes.

-   **Swap Guns**: Switch between active guns.

-   **Reload**: Trigger reload effects.

-   **Dismount**: Exit the vehicle. Counts as Movement for your turn.

-   **Exchange**: Change seats, if any, to an empty seat, or with
    another player. Counts as Movement for your turn. *(Generates 1
    mayhem.)*

Being inside a vehicle isn't all fun and games. **[(Tho it should
be!)]** When a vehicle's Armor reaches 0 (Zero), it ~~breaks.~~
**[explodes.]** Anyone inside the vehicle**[, or next to it,
takes its Slam damage as it blows up and]** lands in a space they
previously occupied while in the vehicle. **[(If the vehicle was a
living creature, it still explodes. Fantasy, amirite?)]**

**[Extra Large Vehicles]**

Some vehicles aren't just big, they're hella big. Like, maybe have rooms
and stuff big. Vehicles like this still have seats, maybe a *lot* of
seats, but they are also big enough to be a battle map where if you
aren't in a seat you can walk around and do stuff like normal. Think
like… big boats and trains. Like a pirate ship. Or a moving castle.
Vehicles big enough to be maps don't usually have **Armor** or
**Repair** traits, since they're more set pieces than actual vehicles,
they're so big it'd take a stupid amount of damage to destroy them.
**[(But you can totally give them stupid big numbers if you want your
players or baddos to blow 'em up. I'll not only allow it, I encourage
it! BURN ALL THE BABIES!!!)]**

**[Vehicle Parts]**

Vehicles are somewhat customizable. While you can't turn one vehicle
Frame into another, you can swap out some parts from one vehicle Frame
to another Frame, changing its stats, its weapons, and even giving it
special abilities. There are ~~four~~**[Five]** types of Parts
available.

-   **Armor**: The vehicle's frame and plating. Affects Armor, Boost
    Meter, Movement, and Slam. There are four types of armor:
    Ultralight, Light, Heavy, and Ultraheavy.

-   **Booster**: The vehicle's engine. Affects Boost Meter, Movement,
    and Slam.

-   **Tires**: The vehicle's wheels. Affects Boost Meter and Movement.
    Come in Mono, Duo, Quad, and Tread. **[(Run them all
    over!)]**

-   **Weapon**: Your vehicle's weapons. Come in two flavors: Light, and
    Heavy. These parts don't change how your vehicle handles, just how
    it hurts. **[(Unless you want it to, boo. It's your game!)]**

-   **[(Cosmetics!: Make it look nice! These add to the Badassery stat.
    If you got a dope ride people will respect you. Or maybe try to jack
    it. I dunno.)]**

You can modify any of your vehicle's Parts at a garage, but you can only
change their Parts once per Pan'Dorahn day. If your vehicle is
destroyed, you can summon a new one from a Catch-A-Chariot station for
10% of your Gold.

**[Damage Progression]**

As you increase in levels, the damage dealt by your vehicles will
increase as well. They'll always hit ***just*** harder than you, but the
tradeoff is that you can't take them everywhere. Eventually, you have to
hoof it. Vehicle Slam and Weapon Damage follows a basic Damage
Progression. Weapons have a base amount of damage dice they roll, and
certain parts can increase or decrease that Progression. Whenever you
reach a new Level Milestone, increase the Progression by one.

[Milestones]: Level **7**, Level **13**, Level **19**, Level
**25**.

The following are just examples of vehicles you can find or make, and
are by no means an extensive list of things you can build, drive, and/or
steal. What do I look like to you, someone who knows what an engine
looks like? Someone who knows all the different breeds of car? I'm
writing a book about imaginary murder and magic and magical murder. For
*nerds*. Get off my back.

**[Frames]**

Frames are what type of vehicle you're driving, and determine its base
stats and what parts can be swapped out at a garage. ***[(All vehicles
can have as many cosmetics as you want. 'Cuz I said so. But, like, only
one of each one. You can't have, like, [two] hood ornaments.
That's dumb. And tacky.)]***

*Beast Cart*

**Base Armor**: 50

**Armor**: Any

**Repair**: 10

**Size**: 2x3 squares

**Tires**: Quad

**Boost Meter**: 2 (*Beasts*)

**Seats**: Driver (*Beast*), Seats (x4)

**Base Slam**: 1d8

**Parts**: Armor (x1), Tires, Booster (*Beasts* x2)

**Special**: The Beast Cart is drawn by two Beasts (Usually Skags, but
maybe horses, or dragons if you're a badass,) that act as *Basic
Engines,* but also act as Driver Weapons. The Driver can make Attack
actions using the Beast's Attacks. You can swap out Beasts like you
would normal boosters, and they grant any special movement they have to
the Cart. (Yes, Dragons would make your cart fly. No, it doesn't make
sense, but it's awesome, so I'm putting it in. What, you gonna complain?
About my game full of magic and dragons and wands that are not
explicitly but heavily implied to be guns?) [(If your ride goes BOOM,
the Beasts explode too! But don't worry, they'll come back along with
your ride whenever you use a Catch-A-Chariot station, just like the
cart.)]

**Special**: Pandoracorns are exceedingly rare. And getting one to let
you ride it is even rarer. Riding one costs 1 Badass Token for each hour
you ride it, and you can't respawn one that dies at a Catch-a-Chariot
station. Also if you let one die, others might not be super happy to let
you ride them in the future, so be careful.
